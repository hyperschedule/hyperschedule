Africana studies, while still relatively young, has a vibrant history that traces the lives and scholarship of people from African descent. Its complex and latent development in academia follows from the socio-political marginalization of people within the African diaspora. Nevertheless, resilience and perseverance will be repeated themes as we study how, through different techniques and modes of understanding, people of the African diaspora have continually challenged the western hegemony of academic study.||``||"

The global rise of black comedy as a commodity and marker of identity in the 21st century demands that we reconsider how black cultural formations like comedy are embodied, evaluated, and critiqued within American culture. This seminar serves as an introduction to the history and practices of black comic cultures, and focuses on major themes, styles, and historical events that inform contemporary genres of black comedy. We will use comedy as a means to help us think about how American cultures and identities have been shaped, challenged, and transformed by way of performance."

This seminar takes an anthropological approach to knowledge and knowledge-making practices; it explores connections between rationality and culture. We will ask how and where, in which kinds of practices, 'scientific rationality' -- as we will call it for the moment -- is 'located.' What is it about this kind of rationality that is so compelling? Are other kinds of rationalities thinkable, possible, or plausible? Are such other kinds of rationalities perhaps 'at work' even as we speak, in parallel with, or embedded in, the ways in which scientists make knowledge? To answer thee questions, we will examine objectivity and calculatory logic -- the elements of 'scientific rationality.' Are objectivity and logic perhaps values as much as they are practices? We will then mine the anthropological literature for alternate logics than the ones we take for granted, examining magical thinking, belief, and indigenous practices that define for 'us' what is 'irrational.' Are such practices perhaps less irrational than we assume them to be? Finally, we will take on actual scientific practices of knowledge-making, empirically and anthropologically. We may assume that rationality as we know it imbues such practices. But are they perhaps informed by alternate logics as well? Here is where subjectivity and affect come into our picture of what scientific practices are made of; we will try to give such alternate values a place in how the bodies that 'do' science act, think, and make knowledge.

From  Old  World  Lit  to Chica  Lit,  we  will  ask  ourselves  how  the  models  of  womanhood  and  female  liberation andautonomy presented in these texts align themselves and/or challenge U.S. American, Latin American, European and Latina feminisms to date. We will question whether the shifting constructions of sexuality, gender roles, and family/inter-generational tiescombined with the experience of immigration, transmigration, hybridity and  border  culture  fashion  a  new  Latina  subject  emerging  within  the  realities  of  consumerism  and globalization."

New forms emerged such as modern and postmodern dance, butoh, styles of professional folk dancing that first developed in Eastern Europe and classical Asian traditions that had never been presented outside of the courts in which they had developed. In addition, the 19th century saw the beginnings of Broadway musicals, and the 20th century the development of dance for the movies, and later television, which dramatically increased the demand for dance performances. The course will look at the ways these various professional dance genres have developed and the role they play in the concert scene today.||``||"

A social activity such as a school dance or dancing in a club, 2. A form of entertainment as in a Broadway or Hollywood musical or a television program like 'Dancing with the Stars,' or 3. A form of artistic production like Giselle or choreography by Martha Graham. In this class we will look at dance in a different way. We will look at dance as a vehicle for achieving political goals, for representing the state, for building ethnic identities, for demonstrating national pride. We will first conceptualize the idea of dance as a political vehicle and then we will look at specific examples: Irish step dancing, Ukrainian and Russian folk dancing, the Hawaiian hula, the Argentine tango and Turkish folk dancing, among others, all of which have served regimes of various political stripes."

Students will examine the formation of Asian American genders and sexualities alongside histories of racialization, migration, and labor that span East, South, and Southeast Asian, as well as Pacific contexts. In our engagement with transpacific movements of people and culture, we will foreground settler colonial occupations of the Pacific Islands and highlight the work of decolonial queer-feminist thinkers like Haunani-Kay Trask, Maile Arvin, and Stephanie Nohelani Teves. We will attend to the incommensurability of migrant and indigenous frameworks, even as we move through the persistence and at times concurrence of multiple forms of colonialism that connect Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. Some questions we will address include: How do historical contexts (i.e. the Cold War, 9/11, Japanese internment) affect Asian American gender formations? What does the popular (Orientalist depictions of Asian women from Geisha Girl to Tiger Mom) have to do with the geo-political (U.S. economic relations with Asia)? How might an Asian American queer politics reveal the limitations of the model minority myth? How can centering Pacific Islander onto-epistemologies decolonize notions of gender and sexuality?"

Ferrante, not of immediate success in Italy where her works were originally published, quickly gained international readership with the translation of her tetralogy, L'amica geniale. The effect of Ferrante's international success has resulted in what scholars are coining 'the Ferrante effect,' an increased attention to works by women writers. In the first half of this course, we will read narratives by and about Elena Ferrante, as well as watch cinematic and serialized adaptations of her work. In the second half of the course, we will explore 'the Ferrante effect,' reading authors, such as Anna Maria Ortese, Igiaba Scego, and Claudia Durastanti, who have gained or regained recognition through republication or translation as part of 'the Ferrante effect.' In reading these works, we will question what they have to offer a global audience, what it means to be a 'woman writer,' and if we can consider 'the Ferrante effect' a trans-national feminist movement. Course is taught in Italian. "

Are monsters only very scary things, or do they have a social and cultural function? In this course we will take up this and other questions as we investigate the nature of the monstrous. Moreover, we will explore the libidinal charge that the recognition of the monstrous or unnatural being evokes. Thus, we will examine both the physical and psychological permutations of monstrosity. In this course, we will consider monsters in their non-human, alien, and technological forms as well as some truly terrifying human monsters.||``||||``||HSA Writing Intensive: Yes."

Pilates is an abdominally based workout that is designed to create postural strength focusing on the abdominal as well as the small intrinsic muscles that support our spinal column.

The innovative method of exercise demands intense focus on certain muscle groups while all the time engaging the abdominals. This type of activity increases strength and flexibility around the spinal column as well as other major muscle groups.

To what extent ought it be so?  To explore these questions, this course will make stops at important moments in the history of philosophysuch as Descartes' armchair philosophizing and Carol Gilligan's interviewing women about moralityon its way to the present movement called 'experimental philosophy,' wherein philosophers conduct experiments similar to those in cognitive and social science in order to address philosophical questions. Students will learn how philosophers think about intuitions and the roles they play in grounding and challenging theories in ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, etc. In addition, students will explore important intersections between philosophy and science, such as the emergence of neurophilosophy and moral psychology in the 20th century. The armchair isn't going anywhere, but neither is the question of which methods of inquiry, namely those empirically informed, are part of the philosopher's toolkit in addressing diverse questions about mind, knowledge, and morality.

Does the state respond to citizens, serve capitalists, or is it used by bureaucrats? Where and how do citizens engage in politics together and try to create change?  ||``||Political sociology addresses these and other questions. Central to political sociology is the question of how power in society is constructed, legitimated, sustained, and challenged. With a primary focus on the United States, the first half of the fall 2021 version of the course will analyze group power and daily life (including #MeToo and white fragility), white nationalism and the Republican party, fascist politics, and the Democratic partyas changing relationship to working class concerns. The middle part of the class steps back to examine the notion of democracy and the global eliteas ability to coopt resistance through neoliberal ideology. Finally, in the last section of the course students will examine social movements generating radical challenges to current forms of inequality and political power, including Black Lives Matter, the #NoDAPL campaign at Standing Rock, Latinx political power, and the fight for a liveable climate future, specifically examining efforts to promote a Green New Deal. ||``||"

The class emphasizes using sources to craft well-organized, original scholarly arguments. Students will practice writing in several different expository and argumentative genres, including autobiography, reflection, explanation of concepts, and defending a position on a controversial issue. Before each assignment, we will spend time discussing the writing process, from brainstorming to making final revisions and acknowledging sources. Students will also have the opportunity to learn from peers by critiquing their written work. There will also be a midterm exam. ||``||A series of shorter analysis papers will culminate in a longer final paper that will require additional reading and research on a specific political or social issue. This paper should be based on a research question that is meaningful to you personally- something that you feel passionately about. You will investigate what respected scholars have had to say regarding this issue. After weighing the evidence presented within these sources, you will formulate your own position and express it in a scholarly way. ||``||"

What does multilingualism mean and look like? How does the ability to communicate in multiple languages shape and enrich one's writing? This seminar will apply the many different theoretical frameworks that define multilingualism and examine our own diverse experiences with writing and translanguaging. This course seeks to analyze how language, culture, class, and identity affect our ways of communicating through speaking and writing, and apply strategies to help us make choices that build on our strengths and enhance our communication skills."

Students will engage independent research on topical issues of personal or political interest, seek out the best outlets for these, then write (and workshop) academic and creative pieces related to their research. The objective of the course is to have students engage in and distinguish between forms of writing, gain confidence in them, and to pliably move between them as they seek to connect their interests with appropriate reading audiences. What distinguishes research from academic as opposed to creative non/fiction pieces? Where can autobiography or personal experience intersect in such writing? What rhetorical strategies work best in sustained academic or creative non/fiction intended for informed audiences and invested publics? "

We will then examine a range of approaches to podcasting and the ways in which these approaches connect with and disrupt other forms of argument?driven writing. Students will select a podcast and analyze the way it presents and tells a story about a specific topic, considering both the text and accompanying audio content and sounds. Students will then create and deliver their own podcast episode.||``||||``||This course is an Inside-Out course. Inside-Out courses are regular college courses that are part of the international Inside-Out Prison Exchange Center model that 'bring together campus-based college students with incarcerated students for a semester-long course held in a prison.' The Claremont Colleges Inside-Out program takes place at California Rehabilitation Center, a level II men's prison in Norco, CA. These courses are slated as 'Permission of Instructor Required' so that the faculty members can fully explain the nature of the course and request students to complete an application or interview prior to enrollment. Students should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing (available through Student Healthcare Services for $10), and the need to submit personal information for background checks.||``||"
