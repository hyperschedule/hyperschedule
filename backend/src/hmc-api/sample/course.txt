Africana studies, while still relatively young, has a vibrant history that traces the lives and scholarship of people from African descent. Its complex and latent development in academia follows from the socio-political marginalization of people within the African diaspora. Nevertheless, resilience and perseverance will be repeated themes as we study how, through different techniques and modes of understanding, people of the African diaspora have continually challenged the western hegemony of academic study.

In this course, we will consider several disciplines, such as art history, psychology, and philosophy, and their intersection with Africana Studies. We will discuss how these disciplines approach Africana Studies and how Africana Studies scholars can employ disciplinary lenses. In the process of producing a research paper this semester, you will explore and select the methods for which you will conduct your research.
|#|AFRI014  AF|^|Unruly Bodies:  Black Womanhood|^|PAFR|^||^|PO|^|In this course we will explore and critically analyze representations of black womanhood in popular culture. Closely reading texts, television, music, comedy, and artistic works from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, we will think through some of the processes by which black women's bodies are socially, politically, and culturally constructed as dangerous, disruptive, and out of control. Another major goal of the course is to consider the various strategies black women take up to foreground pleasure, and various ways of seeing black bodies as healthy and adequate. We can do so by examining competing versions of 'black womanhood,' looking at how ideas about the discourse  circulate around the hegemonic idea of black women and black femininity as unruly. Letter grade only.|#|AFRI020  PZ|^|Intro African American Psych|^|ZAFR|^||^|PZ|^|Situating the study of human development in the context of culture has gained tremendous momentum over the past few decades.  This course is designed to examine theoretical and empirical issues relating to the psychology of African Americans.  Specific attention will be given to (1) traditional and africentric approaches to the study of African American Psychology, (2) issues of measurement of the minority personality (testing bias, intelligence testing etc), and (3) individual and developmental issues, such as cognition, self-concept, self-esteem and racial identity.  This course begins with an overview African American Psychology as an evolving field of study and considers the African American paradigm as one of the key conceptual frameworks for understanding the psychological experiences of African Americans. |#|AFRI114  AF|^|Unruly Bodies:  Black Womanhood|^|PAFR|^||^|PO|^|In this course we will explore and critically analyze representations of black womanhood in popular culture.

Such thinkers and activists have linked their efforts to Marx, Lenin, and other central figures, while simultaneously molding Marxism to address the circumstances of people of African descent and infusing the philosophy with approaches from the Black radical tradition. The course will examine classic Marxist texts alongside Black radical contributions and interventions to deepen our understanding of racial capitalism and to illuminate possibilities for liberation that come from a Marxist praxis deeply engaged with important approaches in Black thought. |#|AFRI119  JT|^|Africana Journal & New Media|^|SAFR|^|05.0201|^|PZ|^|Students research conceptual frameworks toward creating and maintaining an Africana Studies journal. The journal may include new media formats such as blogs and podcasts, in addition to traditional article formats. Following the practices of Black feminist theory, the journal encourages writing that includes authorial experience and positionality.|#|AFRI120  PZ|^|B(L)ack to Nature: Poetry & Thry|^|ZAFR|^||^|PZ|^|B(L)ack to Nature: Poetry & Theory

This course introduces students to poetic forms in relation to the subject of nature in 20thC African American poetry. Through the study of authors such as Lucille Clifton, Ntozake Shange, Nikki Giovanni, Sonia Sanchez, June Jordan, and Claudia Rankine students explore formal aesthetic strategies of and practice writing free verse, vignette, haiku, choreopoem, blues, and spoken word. Through readings and research in Black feminist geography studies students learn the critical contexts of and develop an aesthetic understanding in relation to the representational politics of nature and gender in African American poetic expression.|#|AFRI120  PZ|^|B(L)ack to Nature: Poetry & Thry|^|ZAFR|^||^|PZ|^|B(L)ack to Nature: Poetry & Theory

This course will be a general introduction to Africana Philosophy. We will unveil not only that philosophy is more than the western world and has points of origin in other places, such as Africa, but we will also discover how Africana philosophy serves as a challenge to the integrity of integral concepts and themes in modern western philosophy; for example, the subject, freedom, the human, and even ontology. We will achieve these insights through a survey of thinkers, writers, and people who address themes such as traditional africana thought, black existentialism, black feminism, post colonialism, whiteness, double consciousness, and afro-pessimism. Cross-listed as PHIL109IOCM.

Students should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing (available through Student Healthcare Services for $10), and the need to submit personal information for background checks. Students will be asked to pay a $15 course fee to cover the cost of a required safety whistle and a class t-shirt, to be donned by all students for all class sessions. |#|AFRI125  AF|^|Afro-Pessimism Politics of Hope|^|MIDS|^|05.0201|^|CM|^|This course will survey the deep and dark history of dreams, accomplishments and roadblocks that have constituted and continue to influence the ways Blacks in America negotiate a compromised political position. Traversing history from the brutality of the captured slave, to reformation and Jim Crow, to the Civil Rights movement and the modern day reflections on the role of civil society, police, and entertainment; we will reflect on the desires, goals, and hurdles that Blacks have faced all the while trying to articulate a sense of freedom within a white supremacist regime by following two lines of political thought: a Politics of Hope and Afro-Pessimism.

|#|AFRI127  AF|^|Hip Hop, Reggae, and Religion|^|SAFR|^|05.0201|^|PZ|^|Hip-hop and reggae are among the worldâs most popular musical art forms.  Contextualizing the emergence of these cultural formations, we will interrogate the dynamic relationships between them and the religio-political imagination of the Black Atlantic.  We will pay particular attention to the ways that the various cultures of hip-hop and reggae offer critique to Christianity and contemporary arrangements of power.  Listening to the religio-political perspectives expressed in these cultural formations students will question whether or not the music provides a prophetic challenge to the status quo of our political and economic arrangements.  Giving attention to the music, from the Negro Spirituals, to contemporary Hip Hop and Dancehall, we will contextualize it with an interest in understanding the relationship between their religious and political visions.  Weekly, we will encounter material from numerous genres as we theorize the music.  Assignments will include discussion posts, presentations, a music review, and a final paper.|#|AFRI127  PZ|^|Hip Hop, Reggae, and Religion|^|ZAFR|^||^|PZ|^||#|AFRI134  PO|^|Black Comic Cultures|^|PAFR|^||^|PO|^|African American humor can be traced to the period of enslavement, largely an underground phenomenon until the middle of the 20th century when performers like Richard Pryor and Dick Gregory brought it to the mainstream. The global rise of black comedy as a commodity and marker of identity in the 21st century demands that we reconsider how black cultural formations like comedy are embodied, evaluated, and critiqued within American culture. This seminar serves as an introduction to the history and practices of black comic cultures, and focuses on major themes, styles, and historical events that inform contemporary genres of black comedy. We will use comedy as a means to help us think about how American cultures and identities have been shaped, challenged, and transformed by way of performance.|#|AFRI134 PO|^|Black Comic Cultures|^|PAFR|^||^|PO|^|African American humor can be traced to the period of enslavement, largely an underground phenomenon until the middle of the 20th century when performers like Richard Pryor and Dick Gregory brought it to the mainstream.

This course attempts to pull from the margins the cultural and political expressions of black lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people. We will examine both the uneasy structures of black queer life and extraordinary strategies black people have developed for navigating them, discussing how black sexuality is made visible and invisible in popular culture, academic, and political discourse. We will examine representations of black queer poets, musicians, political activists, and filmmakers, in which relations between race, sexuality, and cultural identity are explored. This course will contextualize and expand black queer archives, including visual representations, poetry, autobiography, political essays, fiction, music, and film, with current interdisciplinary scholarship in black queer studies.|#|AFRI144A AF|^|Black Women, Feminism(s) & Arts|^|PAFR|^||^|PO|^|Interdisciplinary seminar explores the ascension of intersectional feminism(s) produced by trailblazing Black women artists, theorists, and activists. Assigned creative and critical interventions interrogate the ways interlocking constructs of race (aestheticized moral ranking system), gender, sexuality, class, religion, and citizenship inform self-perceptions, social status, creative practices, as well as political and economic relationships of power. Situating contemporary feminist work historically, thematically- organized materials highlight key written and visual texts by the nineteenth century and twentieth-century foremothers. Students will compare and contrast strategies for living, thinking, and visualizing love-driven efforts to raise consciousness, manifest political and economic change, and energize social transformations across the African diaspora.|#|AFRI144A AF|^|Black Women, Feminism(s) & Arts|^|PAFR|^||^|PO|^|Interdisciplinary seminar explores the ascension of intersectional feminism(s) produced by trailblazing Black women artists, theorists, and activists.

Through a sweeping historical survey highlighting the forms and functions of representative artworks in their respective contexts, you will examine such issues as the relationship of Japanese art to Chinese and Korean art, patronage, the ritual and visual functions of Buddhist icons, the translation of concepts into artistic forms, as well as representational strategies and modes of viewing.
|#|AKP 006  PO|^|Japanese Economy|^|PREG|^||^|PO|^|This course is a broad survey of topics having to do with Japan?s economy. Four themes run through the entire course: Japan?s economic growth and development, its integration with the world economy, Japanese government policies and their effects, and Japanese economic institutions and practices.|#|AKP 007  PO|^|Japan in East Asia|^|PREG|^||^|PO|^|The East Asian region is perhaps the success story of post- World War Two economic development. First Japan, then the Asian Tiger economies, then China and the Tiger Cub economies all experienced periods of sustained economic growth that transformed their societies. Japan was a key player in transforming the East Asian region. As the economies of East Asia have become increasingly integrated, linkages between these societies have also become both deeper and broader. However, the region is also facing considerable challenges. Security issues are dominant, examples being the Korean peninsula, and territorial disputes. Environmental/ natural resource issues provide another set of key challenges. How do we understand these challenges and how do we assess Japan?s responses? This course will begin by outlining the prominent theories of international relations, which will then become the tools we use to analyze the important issues and challenges facing Japan in East Asia. We will pick up a number of prominent case studies from contemporary East Asia, and investigate from the perspective of Japan?s international relations. Importantly, we will be focusing on perspectives from Japan.|#|AKP 008  PO|^|The World of Japanese Cuisine|^|PREG|^||^|PO|^|This course will look at the history of Japanese cuisine and show how the country's obsession with eating well anticipated the global slow food movement and our age of celebrity chefs.|#|AMST103  JT|^|Intro to American Cultures|^|SAMS|^||^|SC|^|This class analyzes the histories and cultures of the U.S., focusing on the experiences of people and communities of color.

Students will learn how to read and analyze texts alongside their social, historical, and political contexts; and with a transnational and global view of the relationships between places, a critical focus on the meanings and realities of "America," and a humanizing view of the complex personhood of migrant subjects.|#|AMST113  SC|^|Asian/American Geographies|^|SAMS|^|05.0102|^|SC|^|What is the relationship between Asian and Asian/American racialization, space, and place? This course brings together questions and texts from Asian American studies, geography, and critical ethnic studies to examine the spatialization of race across multiple scales ranging from the local to the global (e.g., colony, territory, ?Chinatown?) as well as placemaking, activism, and place-based worldviews. Specific areas of inquiry and discussion will include: Asian/American engagements with critical Asian and diaspora studies, relationships to Indigeneity and settler colonialism, U.S. militarism and empire, and questions of cultural and place-based memory.|#|AMST117  PO|^|American Soundscapes|^|PAMS|^||^|PO|^|What does America sound like, and who hears it? This course will reside at the intersection of two interdisciplinary academic fields, American Studies and Sound Studies. How does an attention to the sonic clarify our understanding of American nationhood, empire, and identity in the twenty-first century? Does listening to American culture reveal knowledge that would otherwise be rendered invisible or unreachable? Conversely, in what ways does American Studies? persistent return to the personal and communal help situate the theoretical concepts drawn from other disciplines?  We will engage with primary and secondary sources from a wide range of disciplines, including media studies, anthropology, history, musicology, and sound art in order to better understand the role of the sonic in our constantly developing conceptualizations of "America."|#|AMST118  PO|^|Digital American Studies|^|PAMS|^||^|PO|^|This course examines American Studies methodologies and topics that have accompanied the emergence of new media technologies in recent decades. We will approach such topics as online political movements, representation and identity, algorithms and justice, and issues of sovereignty and surveillance, with special attention to the kinds of methodologies that prove effective to understand them. We will also examine how American Studies intersects with the digital humanities, digital ethnography, electronic archives, and online pedagogy, to better comprehend how new media changes what has always already been an interdisciplinary field. Assignments will allow us to think critically about how online terrains and protocols change the relationships between identity, power, and agency.|#|AMST128  SC|^|Race, Space, and Difference|^|SAMS|^|05.0102|^|SC|^|This course is an introduction to critical scholarship on race and space in the United States. We will consider definitions of race and racism, and how the intertwining of race and differential access to space has shaped patterns of power and inequality. We pay special attention to the making and maintenance of national boundaries; spatial typologies within metropolitan areas; and the differential racialization of Asian Americans, Latinxs, African Americans, and Native Americans. Readings and discussion are organized around spatial typologies including border, ghetto, suburb, and prison.

cultural context. Students will become familiar with basic concepts and qualitative methods in the 
social sciences, including ethnographic fieldwork and the analysis of face-to-face communication. 
We look for ways of answering questions such as these:

 How do everyday conversational practices create solidarity between people, or set them apart from 
one another? How does talk reflect and create relations of power?
 How do words combine with other semiotic modalities (gesture, facial expression, prosody) to 
convey subtle messages?
 Why do miscommunications arise, even between people who speak the same language?
 How do children learn to speak not only grammatically, but also appropriately?
 How does language shape our thoughts or the ways we perceive the world?

In this course, we explore language  as a complex form of social actionnot merely a vehicle for 
communicating thoughts and meanings, but a means of creating the social world. We consider ways 
that language acts on us, and ways that we act through language: achieving relationships, 
constituting identities, constructing norms and patterns of thought, and positioning ourselves and 
others in relation to global systems of power and inequality.

This course examines human histories from the very onset of humanity until 1492 (or so). Fundamental to the course is a rejection of the idea of human "pre-history"; the course understands all of human existence as historical. Topics include: the distinctiveness of humans; histories of agriculture and foods; pre-industrial energy regimes and human impacts on the environment, social inequalities state formations, and resistance to both; world religious traditions; and culture and cultural difference.|#|ANTH011  PZ|^|The World Since 1492|^|ZANT|^||^|PZ|^|This course explores the last 500 years of

environments. Are patterns of collecting wild resources or farming primary foods
environmentally determined? How does the physical environment affect a groups
social system, politics, art, religion? What impact do these cultural factors have
on a groups utilization of its environment? We will examine these and other issues
through class discussions and readings. We will consider several regions of North
America in our study of such groups as the Inuit, Kwakiutl, Cahuilla, Hopi, Navajo,
Dakota and Iroquois.|#|ANTH020  SC|^|Anthropology of Latin America|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|20. Anthropology of Latin America.

|#|ANTH027  SC|^|Contemporary South Asia|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|This course will introduce students to anthropological perspectives on South Asia. South Asia, which is home to a quarter of the world's population, occupies a geopolitically and economically salient space. In this course, students will learn about contemporary issues in South Asia by examining the role of colonialism in shaping its present, by exploring the condition of post-coloniality, and subsequently discussing neoliberal politics in the subcontinent. This course helps students to challenge ethnocentric and delimiting understandings of South Asia, while enabling them to see South Asia for its conceptually generative potential. In this course, we will explore themes such as caste, gender, religious violence, city-making, conservation, and development among others, through ethnographic texts, novels, autobiographies and documentary films.|#|ANTH030  SC|^|Middle Eastern Cities|^||^|45.0201|^|SC|^|Some of the world?s oldest cities are located in the Middle East, including Baghdad, Damascus,  Cairo,  and  Istanbul.

Critically, the course also explores how the figure of the consultant transforms ideas of knowledge-production, political responsibility, urban forms, imperialism, and ideas of the future. Throughout the course, students will explore forms of expertise, new office cultures, the work of public relations, optimization, and design. While the proximity of the consultant to the anthropologist is of particular interest, students will read widely across different academic disciplines which include critical architecture, art history, literature, histories of capitalism, media and technology studies.

A first unit looks at how the evolution of language was tightly linked to the evolution of bipedalism in our Homo lineage. Students will gain an understanding of how language evolved in conjunction with human locomotion and will read recent research on human dispersals and how language diversified as people moved around the globe. Differences and similarities between human language and non-human primate communication will also be explored in this first unit. After studying this picture of linguistic diversity, we then turn to examples of linguistic similarities, such as those between the creole languages spoken by descendants of enslaved peoples throughout the New World. The focus of this second unit is how the massive movements and domination involved in colonialism and slavery affected language communities, as well as the forms of linguistic and orthographic resistance that subjugated communities developed in response. A final unit interrogates what might be learned about the nature of globalization by looking at how people are using language today. If globalization is often described as the dissolution of the nation-state in favor of global forces like ?the market? and transnational organizations, how might speech practices attest to the continued relevance of the local in the construction of human identity? Examples from different contexts will be contrasted in order to better understand the varying outcomes that result when language communities come into contact through migration (e.g., language shift/maintenance/endangerment, diglossia, dialect leveling, code-switching), as well as the identity dynamics and power relations at hand in each of these situations. The course has a speaking-intensive overlay, and it culminates in the student presenting an oral piece (resembling a TED Talk) to their peers on a research topic of their choosing. |#|ANTH053  PO|^|Language and Globalization|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|Through readings, films, and podcasts, this course covers how language and human movement have been intertwined over time, from early human dispersals through modern migrations.

This course is a survey of the broad literature on social movements and activist organizing
in Latin America. The region, itself a construction built on shared histories of colonialism and nationalism, has
undergone vast changes in the last few decades, through which we can see emerging new social movements,
engagements with global capitalism, and changing political relations between people, the environment, and
the state. This course is designed to introduce students to anthropological theorizing about social movements
and forms of protest, with a particular focus on Latin American collective struggles around race and
indigeneity, citizenship and inequality, gender and sexuality, and environmental justice. The second half of the
course examines five unique ethnographic approaches to the study of contemporary issues in activism and
social movement across Latin America, from the use of different forms of media, to examples of youth
resistance, the building of new democracies, and efforts to decolonize research methodologies.

His film essay is an exorcism of the world, a melancholy, critical farewell-but Sans Soleil is also about the world, a visual celebration of that world: at once exorcism and homage; a leave-taking and a reverent, fine-grained representation. That is the tension inherent in the essay: a global, culturally rich form in writing, photography, and film that both makes the world strange and holds it intimately close, a form that criticizes the world and also loves it. If we are conditioned by our education to think of the essay as academic, five-paragraph, caught up in the power, conventions, and privileges of the academy and belles lettres, this course explores a different way of writing, photographing, filming. Since its formal inception in the sixteenth-century the essay-associative, digressive, fragmentary; filled with the presence of the author-has been defined and redefined as everything from a stay against fascism to the "writing on the walls of the prison house of culture," a way of resisting the deadening status quo, a "matter of life and death." We will study the history of the essay as a form and write, photograph, draw, and film our own essays in order to understand what the essay is, how it works, and what social and political force it might, and does, have. A course in literature, film, and visual anthropology (taught by faculty from English and Anthropology), we will be thinking about the relationship between powers of resistance and modes of representation. Assignments will be both written and visual; you will learn to film your own essay.

|#|ANTH113  SC|^|Ethnographic Tales of the City|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|Students in this course will examine the ways ethnographic fieldwork methods have been applied to research in urban settings, explore global patterns of urbanization and urban sociality, and consider the distinct theoretical and epistemological issues that arise from the cultural analysis of urban life. Seminar participants will critically engage a range of recent and classic urban ethnographies from around the world and conduct their own investigations. 
|#|ANTH114  SC|^|Science, Medicine & Colonialism|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|This seminar examines the role of empire in shaping medical and scientific knowledge and practice. Beginning in the eighteenth century, as major scientific developments were unfolding in Europe and the United States, these regions were engaging in colonial expansion in Africa, Asia and the Americas. These two processes were often linked. Colonial aims influenced medico-scientific paradigms, and emergent scientific knowledge shaped how colonizers governed and controlled populations. This course examines these intertwined historical processes and how they laid the foundations for medico-scientific research and practice today. Drawing on anthropological and historical texts, we examine key themes such as scientific racism, hygiene and morality, and the regulation of indigenous knowledges. Throughout, we engage with concepts of the postcolonial and the settler colonial to help us understand the complexity of connections between past and present. |#|ANTH115  PO|^|Global Latin America|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|This course examines Latin American culture and society through the lens of global interconnections. We will explore how industrialized global capitalism emerged in the plantations in the New World, and how categories of race were constructed in the colonies and later in the newly independent nation states. Additionally, the course will examine the production of global connections in terms of social movements, neoliberalism, migration, and networks of knowledge. Finally, we will look at nostalgia for an imagined time prior to a globally embedded Latin America.|#|ANTH115  SC|^|Stuff:Social Life of Commodities|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|The world is becoming overstuffed by stuff.

Currently, we are in the midst of one of the most significant technological shifts in human history because of digital technologies. Using anthropology as cultural critique, we will examine the new (and not-so-new) cultural, political and material practices connected digital technology. Topics covered include activism, identity, friendship, hacking, piracy, property, privacy, identity, labor, and embodiment. Course is equivalent to ANTH116  PZ.|#|ANTH117  PO|^|Anthropology of Islam|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|Within anthropology, approaches to Islam and Islamic societies have been the source of much contestation and debate. One approach called "the anthropology of Islam," treats Islam as a "discursive tradition," grounding present and future practices in past textual authorities. This literature has been largely concerned with authority, governance, and public piety. However, this literature is now considered paradigmatic, if not dominant. In this course, we will read the anthropology of Islam with an eye towards what comes next?namely, bringing these important critiques into conversation with media studies, science and technology studies, migration studies, political economy, and queer theory.|#|ANTH118  SC|^|Labor, Work, and Life|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|Drawing on ethnographic, theoretical, and popular sources, the course examines the lived experiences and meanings of work of various forms of labor. The course topics include manufacturing labor, garment labor, call center workers, immaterial and affective labor of designers and writers, platform labors for ride share and delivery services, care workers, and sex workers, in order to understand the historically constructed and newly emerging issues of labor and work from a global perspective.|#|ANTH119  SC|^|East Asia in Ethnography & Film|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|Drawing on various ethnographies, literatures, films and theoretical perspectives, this course explores contemporary East Asian societies around themes related to global mobility and new cultural landscapes.

We will begin with an overview of the use of cooperative filmmaking efforts and community-based history projects in various contexts. Students will learn about the ways in which cooperative and collaborative filmmaking practices can challenge the paradigms of commercial filmmaking in terms of content, production and distribution. Students will also have the opportunity to collaborate with a community-based organization in the city of Pomona to produce short videos as part of an ongoing filmmaking practice for social change.|#|ANTH127  SC|^|Settler Colonialism|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|This seminar examines processes of settler colonialism and the experiences of indigenous peoples. The central premise of this course is that colonialism is an ongoing process in many parts of the world; we will examine how it operates through sites such as sovereignty, land and territory, medicine, gender and sexuality, and others. At the same time, we will look at how indigenous practices and movements have sought to carve out spaces for critique and resistance.|#|ANTH128  SC|^|Refugees, Migrants, Citizenship|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|Who has the right to travel, to remain, or to belong? This course considers new approaches to migration and citizenship through ethnographic case studies examining a diverse array of refugee and immigrant experiences. How do exclusion and inclusion impact ideas of citizenship, race, and identity? How is mobility enabled, disabled, and regulated by state and non-state actors in ways that impact integration and belonging? In working through these questions, students will conduct anthropological analyses to draw out the intersections of migration, identity, and citizenship. |#|ANTH129  SC|^|Politics of Public Art|^|SANT|^|45.0201|^|SC|^|In this class we will explore the politics of public art. While we will look at the political messaging of public art, we will also seek to understand how public art, through its integration into a social geography, has a political impact beyond its meaning. We will see how art claims public space and structures social action, how art shapes social groups, and how art channels economic flows or government power. We will examine how art enters into urban contest and global inequality.|#|ANTH134  HM|^|Rationalities|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|What does it mean to be rational? Does it mean anything, to say that you are thinking rationally? This seminar takes an anthropological approach to knowledge and knowledge-making practices; it explores connections between rationality and culture. We will ask how and where, in which kinds of practices, "scientific rationality" -- as we will call it for the moment -- is "located." What is it about this kind of rationality that is so compelling? Are other kinds of rationalities thinkable, possible, or plausible? Are such other kinds of rationalities perhaps "at work" even as we speak, in parallel with, or embedded in, the ways in which scientists make knowledge? To answer thee questions, we will examine objectivity and calculatory logic -- the elements of "scientific rationality." Are objectivity and logic perhaps values as much as they are practices? We will then mine the anthropological literature for alternate logics than the ones we take for granted, examining magical thinking, belief, and indigenous practices that define for "us" what is "irrational." Are such practices perhaps less irrational than we assume them to be? Finally, we will take on actual scientific practices of knowledge-making, empirically and anthropologically. We may assume that rationality as we know it imbues such practices. But are they perhaps informed by alternate logics as well? Here is where subjectivity and affect come into our picture of what scientific practices are made of; we will try to give such alternate values a place in how the bodies that "do" science act, think, and make knowledge.

By taking infrastructures seriously as processes that can be made to enable (or impede) certain kinds of relations or movements, as well as devices that can function as important symbolic projects, this class will raise a number of interrelated questions. What sorts of histories become apparent when looking at the emergence of particular kinds of infrastructures? How can we approach questions of environmental justice by studying the mundane infrastructures of daily life? Which communities are made more vulnerable to risk by particular kinds of infrastructure planning, and how can we address these questions using qualitative, ethnographic methods?

It provides an introduction to the prehistory of the peoples of Mesoamerica (comprising all of Guatemala and Belize and parts of Mexico, El Salvador, and Honduras) from roughly 2000 BCE into the 16th century CE. It seeks to provide a definition of their common cultural background and to examine the archaeological record for the origins of these various societies and their rise into complex indigenous civilizations that were finally dismantled following contact with the Spanish in the sixteenth century. Emphasis will be placed on the nature of the archaeological interpretation of these native American cultures and on the diachronic and dynamic relationships between highland Mexican and lowland Maya groups.

Academic Freedom.

This seminar examines academic freedom by probing limits on permissible speech at US colleges and universities, especially faculty speech, during two eras: (i) the present and immediate past and (ii) the long twentieth century. In addition to (i) examining several case studies of controversies over campus speech and (ii) reading key texts that make the case for academic freedom, the course also engages in the praxis of teaching important artistic, political, and scholarly works that push, or perhaps cross, the boundaries of permissibility for classroom teaching in our own time and place.  These works include Joshua Cohen's novel, The Netanyahus, Radu Jude's film, Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn, and one or more ethnographic texts concerned with social worlds in which normative behavior would lead to severe sanctions if it occurred here (on our Claremont Colleges campus) and now (in spring 2023).|#|ANTH155  PO|^|Globalization|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|The nature of globalization and of claims made about it; examination of neoliberalism; transnational labor, media, tourism and youth culture; regional and world systems historically and cross-culturally; globalization of protest; impacts on local communities. |#|ANTH155  PO|^|Globalization|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|The nature of globalization and of claims made about it; examination of neoliberalism; transnational labor, media, tourism and youth culture; regional and world systems historically and cross-culturally; globalization of protest; impacts on local communities. |#|ANTH156  PO|^|Comparative Muslim Societies|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|Comparative Muslim Societies in Asia.

|#|ANTH189L PO|^|Linguistic Anthropology|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|This course provides an intensive introduction to selected theories, methods, and themes in linguistic anthropology, one of the discipline's four subfields. The primary aim of the course is to familiarize students with the linguistic anthropological approach to language, according to which language is a social tool with significance for sociopolitical processes, on the one hand, and basic research methods in linguistic anthropology, on the other. The course has two interwoven parts. The first is the sequence of readings, which will be analyzed in particular for the evidence and methods on which they draw. These readings trace the development of linguistic anthropology chronologically, beginning with the branching of linguistics into the fields of theoretical linguistics and linguistic anthropology, then examining early linguistic anthropologists' inquiries into linguistic relativism and whether language shapes thought, before turning finally to contemporary semiotic approaches to language, illustrated through selected ethnographic examples. The second part of the course is a field practicum in which students will observe language in the social setting of their choice, produce field notes, and draft written analyses guided by questions that we will consider at length. Via their fieldwork students will become adept at using a range of methods for collecting data and analyzing how people use language, including participant observation, interviews, field notes, audio recordings, and discourse analytic transcriptions. The course also has a writing-intensive overlay; accordingly, throughout the semester students will write up a series of shorter ethnographic analyses that they will then revise and collate into an original research paper. |#|ANTH189L PO|^|Linguistic Anthropology|^|PANT|^||^|PO|^|This course provides an intensive introduction to selected theories, methods, and themes in linguistic anthropology, one of the discipline's four subfields.

Practically it aims to help students who plan to write theses on topics involving cultural representation to (a) formulate research questions; (b) situate their work in and against a relevant body of existing writing, and (c) structure their own descriptions and arguments.  Intellectually, it aims to introduce students to some of the ways anthropologists have thought about the processes and politics of writing about culture(s) and people(s).  Required for Scripps anthropology majors choosing the sociocultural track, the course is open (with the instructor's permission) to students whose thesis or other major writing project would be enhanced by an examination of the issues and debates surrounding ethnographic writing.

Working in painting, sculpture, performance, still photography, motion pictures, literature, and readymades, the Dadaists and Surrealists redefined these mediums while also pioneering tactics of abstraction, automatism, and montage that remain vital, relevant, and widespread. This seminar considers the history of the two movements, beginning with Dada?s emergence in New York and Zurich in the mid 1910s and that of Surrealism in 1920s Paris, and addresses their ongoing impact around the world.   |#|ARHI178  PO|^|Black Aesth/Poli (Re)presentatn|^|PARH|^||^|PO|^|Course examines the visual arts (including painting, sculpture, photography, prints, textiles, mixed media, installations, performance, independent film and video) produced by people of African descent in the United States from the colonial era to the present.

Starting with questions that explore the uses (and abuses) of the rubric "Asian American Art," this class will consider different contexts for work by Asian American artists and the ways that they can illuminate conversations about race in the U.S., the role that art can play in coalescing complex notions of community, and the nexus of art and its public reception both historically and at our contemporary moment. We will also chart intersections and parallels with contemporaneous African American, LatinX/ChicanX, and Feminist art movements. Class work will include responses to readings and artworks.

In spring 2022, this course examines the artistic movements of Dada and Surrealism from the beginning of World War I to the end of World War II, with stops in Zurich, Berlin, Cologne, New York, and Paris. It will explore how painters, photographers, filmmakers, and writers challenged aesthetic, political, and social conventions in such forms as the visual arts, poetry, and performance and will look at how Surrealism subsumed Dada, dominated Paris, and spread during World War II through a diaspora of artistic emigres to Latin America and the United States.

We will consider how, when, and why a building entered the canon of Persian art history (or was excluded from it), how its appearance and function have evolved over time, and how its ground reality compares with its often veneered and fragmented treatment in the museum. While the course focuses mainly on sites within historical Iran, it also considers the recasting of Persian architecture in more recent centuries in such distant locales as Honolulu, Copenhagen, and Kuala Lumpur. In doing so, we balance the study of Persian architecture between the past and present, local and global, and a wide variety of stakeholders and interests.|#|ARHI186W PO|^|Interrog Whiteness:Race,Sex,Rep|^|PARH|^||^|PO|^|Interdisciplinary course studying select African disaporan visual arts interrogating linguistic, conceptual, and visual solipsisms contributing to the construction and reproduction of whiteness in aesthetics, studio art, film, video, and social media.

the linear historical trajectories of art history and modernism, embodying what one critic
has called the âasynchronous temporalitiesâ of a densely connected, yet unevenly

writings, and selected projects by artists, this seminar will examine how artists, curators,
and scholars engage with multiple pasts, uncertain futures, and the fraught present.

possibility of embodied education for critical consciousness and social action. This class
investigates qi gong as an epistemological framework and an embodied practice related
to liberatory pedagogies. Rooted in traditional Chinese medicine, qi gong involves
breathing, awareness, and movement and centers interconnectedness as the basis for
its knowledge system. Combining discussion of readings and experiential practice, we
will engage in a community-engaged project that includes relational mindfulness, qi
gong, and other contemplative practices.

Spring 2012 Topic: Contemporary Asian American Media.
This student-led course will focus on media in the Asian American community, with a focus on the role that mass- and independent-media play in domestic and transnational cultural exchange and appropriation, Asian/Asian-American representations, Orientalism, race and sexuality, and political activism.

Chinese philosopher Zhang Zai (1020-1077) defined it as "the one source of all things." This is one of many definitions given by Chinese intellectuals, who emphasized
different aspects of human nature to present arguments on moral behavior, political philosophy, affection theories, human interactions, etc. This course explores how the question of what is human nature has been answered by philosophers from the fourth century BCE (when the debate first emerged) to the end of the imperial era, in the 19th century CE, passing through the challenges presented by the arrival of traditions foreign to the Chinese context, such as Buddhism. We will consider why the topic of human nature became a central one in philosophical expressions, and how varying cultural contexts brought out innovative redefinitions. By taking this course students will also learn to navigate major historical phases of Chinese premodern history.|#|ASIA081  PO|^|A Chinese Culinary History|^|PASI|^||^|PO|^|To many, Chinese cuisine is synonymous with spicy food. Did you know that the Chile peppers now widely used in Chinese cooking were introduced in the region only in the 16th century? This course introduces social and historical developments using culinary history as a prism. What do cooking and food habits tell us of Chinese culture? We will explore these topics through a variety of media ? primary sources, newspapers, photographs, paintings, and movies. The course is divided into sections on the history of food; primary sources and representations of food; and Chinese food outside China. The last four weeks will concentrate on food culture in Shanghai in the last century. |#|ASIA190  PO|^|Senior Thesis Seminar|^|PASI|^||^|PO|^|Senior Thesis Seminar.

Latinx, Indigenous, and Asian American communities to varying scales of violence, from enslavement to 
labor exploitation, land dispossession, and imperial war. While the course focuses on the ways in which 
power has historically and contemporarily manifested in communities of color, we will also study how these 
communities resist, if not imagine, alternative ways of being and knowing.|#|CHLT056  CH|^|Intro to Comprtve Ethnic Studies|^|ZCHL|^||^|PZ|^|Introduction to Comparative Ethnic Studies:

Citizenship is typically thought of as state-granted universal membership in the national community with a guarantee of equality through civil, political, and social rights. However, citizenship is also a terrain of social struggle in which marginalized groups contest their exclusion. Historically, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and other non-Whites have been restricted from full and equal standing in the nation. The high growth-rate of Latino/as since the 1970s has further challenged the notion of liberal inclusion. The key issue of undocumented migration and controversies over 'illegality' further complicate the significance of Latino citizenship within the borders of the United States. This class will incorporate interdisciplinary scholarship, focusing on how Latino/as have claimed rights in the shadow of citizenship. We will draw from legal and political theory, feminist theory, and critical race theory, as well as ethnographies and case studies that surface how citizenship is enacted and embodied. By the end of the course, students will understand the origins of nation-state citizenship, the role that race, gender, class, and labor played in shaping the legal parameters of American citizenship. Students will also be able to analyze how globalization, migration, and U.S. foreign and economic policies have challenged and transformed citizenship. Finally, students will analyze the different ways that subaltern communities have redefined citizenship through in their daily lives.|#|CHST130  CH|^|Voices & Stories CL Communities|^|PCHS|^||^|PO|^|Drawing on Chicana-Latina feminisms, this course centers story-telling as (1) a method to (re)claim Chicanx-Latinx voices and histories in multiple spaces and institutions, including families and communities; and (2) as a form of everyday resistance and institutional transformation.

Letter grade only.|#|CHST136  CH|^|Latinx Social Movements|^|PCHS|^||^|PO|^|Latin/o/a/xs have historically used grassroots community organizing and social movement participation to press for socio-political change. Yet, national discourse often falls back on stereotypes of Latino/as' political apathy. This class will explore competing definitions of political participation. By doing so, we will interrogate how race, gender, class, ability and community shape the rates of, and the quality of political participation and activism amongst Latino/a/x communities. While various forms of activism such as union activism, anti-war activism, student activism, and civil rights activism all have appeared within the broader category of "Latino/a" social movements, we will pay special attention to the contemporary immigrants' rights movement as exemplary of the modes of rights claiming practices that have defined Latino/a social movements historically. |#|CHST140  CH|^|Sanctuary Struggles in the SGV|^|PCHS|^||^|PO|^|Organized into two parts, this workshop-based class provides a collective space to learn about, document and engage with the current struggles for sanctuary in our local communities.

Thereafter, we focus on the struggles for sanctuary cities and schools in the San Gabriel Valley and Inland Empire since the 2016 presidential election. Working together, we will collect, review, and analyze oral histories, city and school board minutes, newspaper articles, and sanctuary resolutions from cities such as Pomona, Claremont, La Puente, West Covina, San Dimas, Upland, Glendora, and San Gabriel. Some attention will also be given to current movements by local religious organizations.

By considering Latina literature in  particular  and  its  engagement   with   multiple  feminisms,   we   will   see a  landscape   marked  by contradictions  and  conflict  with  ?First  World?  feminism  and  determined  from  within  by  culture, colonialism, history, and geography. Our attention to literary renderings of the feminist experience will be informed  by  a  recurrent  emphasis on representations  of  history  and  issues  of  gender,  terms  that  can  be understood  culturally,  historically,  economically,  racially,  and  geographically.  From  Old  World  Lit  to Chica  Lit,  we  will  ask  ourselves  how  the  models  of  womanhood  and  female  liberation andautonomy presented in these texts align themselves and/or challenge U.S. American, Latin American, European and Latina feminisms to date. We will question whether the shifting constructions of sexuality, gender roles, and family/inter-generational tiescombined with the experience of immigration, transmigration, hybridity and  border  culture  fashion  a  new  Latina  subject  emerging  within  the  realities  of  consumerism  and globalization.|#|CHST184D CH|^|Chicanx Short Fiction|^|SCHS|^|05.0203|^|SC|^|A wide compendium of short stories written by Mexican Americans, or Chicanxs will be analyzed, dating from the 1930s to the present day.

Yet anti-epic and anti-heroes often critique the values woven into traditional epic form. This course surveys the role of epic heroes/heroines across ancient, medieval, and modern times in order to better understand the changing conceptions of heroes: what kinds of knowledge do epic heroes produce and how does this knowledge relate to our lives?

Focus on the fundamental questions in ancient Greek moral thinking, such as the following: What is the best kind of life for a human? Should I be good? Can I be good? Is morality objective, subjective, or relative to ones society? What is the relation between gods and humans? Are we at the mercy of fate?|#|CLAS106  PO|^|Ancient Greek Leadership|^|PCLA|^||^|PO|^|From the rage-filled rivalries of Homer's heroes to the Hellenistic game of thrones launched by Alexander the Great, vigorous debates about the character and consequences of (good) leadership were a prominent feature of ancient Greek literature and politics (ca. 750-300 B.C.). Here, through close reading and discussion of battlefield harangues and Assembly deliberations, of despotic tyranny and democratic nudging, we will explore together the contours of these ancient Greek conversations as leadership evolved and eventually began to be theorized. Our seminar readings will include both modern scholarship and ancient sources, the latter drawn primarily from Homer's Iliad, from the historiographies of Herodotus and Thucydides, and from the writings of the fourth-century scholar-warrior Xenophon (including his Socratic Memorabilia, his campaign memoir Anabasis, and his Cyropaedia, an extended meditation on the ideal leader).

What can we know about how sexuality and gender shaped the lived realities of historical Romans? How were normative models of gender and sexuality constructed and enforced in the Roman world? Do we have evidence of counter-cultural activity or gender/sexuality-based subcultures? In order to develop our own answers to these questions, we will conduct a theoretically-informed exploration of the intersections between gender, sexuality, ethnicity, social class, and political status in the ancient Roman world. We will draw on literary and material evidence, including poetry, medical texts, architecture, and visual art. By utilizing feminist and anti-racist approaches and actively making thoughtful comparisons with our own lived experiences, students in this course will become a community of scholars engaged in a meaningful inquiry into gender and sexuality in Ancient Rome and today. <a href="https://romasexualis2020.wordpress.com"target="_blank">Additional course information for fall 2020.</a>|#|CLAS113  PO|^|History of Sexuality: Clas World|^|PCLA|^||^|PO|^|The ancient Greeks and Romans categorized sexuality differently from modern Westerners.

Through the study of ancient literary and material sources and modern responses to them, students will investigate ancient theories of race and ethnicity, representations of various peoples of the ancient world, and how these theories and representations have influenced modern discussions of race and ethnicity. Students will come away from this course not only with greater appreciation of the human diversity of the ancient Greek and Roman worlds, but also better prepared to engage with issues that are of paramount political importance today. |#|CLAS116A PO|^|Out of The Cave|^|PCLA|^||^|PO|^|In this course, we will study foundational texts in the history of philosophy in order to become philosophers of education ourselves.

Finally, we will develop our own pedagogical stances, answering for ourselves the key questions of the course.  What are the aims of an education?  How do we go about achieving those aims?  In particular, (to speak directly to our place in a liberal arts college), what is the value of studying the humanities, the arts, and sciences, both historically and today? |#|CLAS117  PO|^|Archaeology and Society|^|PCLA|^||^|PO|^|Who owns the past?

In this course, we will work together as an intellectual community to deepen our understanding of ethical issues raised by the practices of archaeology, museology, and the collection and display of material culture. We will begin by studying several archaeological projects and artifact collections from the ancient Mediterranean, including Troy, Knossos, the Parthenon Marbles, and the antiquities collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu. Students will then identify, research, and present relevant case studies of significant interest to the students themselves. By applying diverse theoretical models, including actor-network modeling, thing theory, decoloniality, and feminism, we will develop our own methodologies for the study of archaeology in social context. <a href="https://archaeologyandsociety2020.wordpress.com/"target="_blank">Additional course information for fall 2020.</a>|#|CLAS121  SC|^|Classical Mythology|^|SCLA|^||^|SC|^|This class surveys some of the prominent myths of the ancient Greek and Roman world, with attention to material culture, literary interpretation, theory of myth and modern reception.

This course will examine closely those so-called "enemies of Roman order": religious cults, superstition, personal corruption and excess, popular violence, the Roman obsession with death, the radical decline from Classical models of life and art.

The Core Curriculum in Interdisciplinary Humanities will be a central part of your experience at
Scripps College. The Core is designed to introduce you via interdisciplinary study to some of the
major debates and concepts that have shaped the modern world. The first semester of Core is a
broad foundational course in which students and faculty examine contemporary issues and debates
through a historical lens. Ultimately this course will serve as an introduction to contemporary
humanistic practice.

The current iteration of Core I takes up this task through an examination of crossroads. It considers
the constraints we face both collectively and individually. Often it may seem like we have no
meaningful choices left to make, so powerful do these forces appear. One need only recall the
political situation or global warming to feel an oppressive sense of helplessness; or, at a more
individual level, we may languish under the imperatives of social media or anxiety about success
in school (and, eventually, in a career). But are we truly without options? In addressing these
concerns, we consider how institutions, categories such as race and gender, and other
cultural frameworks influence our sense of possibility. This course considers crossroads in the
sense of crisis but also of choice.  Course description subject to faculty approval. |#|CORE001  SC|^|Histories of the Present|^|SHUM|^||^|SC|^|Core I. Histories of the Present: Crossroads

We will use climate change as an opportunity to explore the impact of our work on society. There are four primary components of that exploration: critical analysis of the social context of STEM, the expansion and application of concepts from the core to understand this social-technical problem, collaborative projects that promote positive change in the world, and communicating our project designs and professional choices. Plenary sessions will explore topics such as environmental justice, earth system science, the relation between expertise and power, policy processes, data science, community engagement, multidisciplinary collaboration, impactful careers, and science communication. Individual sections will explore particular climate-related issues in greater depth. Final team projects will challenge students to apply these concepts in proposals for climate solutions.

Each student joins or brings such a project and, through CS Studio, materially advances its goals by understanding, analyzing, exploring, designing, and implementing new computational capabilities. Equally important are assessment, testing, and iterating across this computing workflow. 

CS Studio's purpose is that each student build skillsets, toolsets, and experience-sets they will bring to future computing challenges. Even as specific technologies vary widely, every CS Studio student will practice (1) exploratory drafting, i.e., exemplifying system behavior outside its context, (2) conceptual shoring, i.e., intentionally pushing beyond a system-as-envisioned to expand on goals, possibilities, and limits, and (3) teamwork-computing: software is communal, and even solo projects benefit from - and depend on - their communities' computational models.

CS Studio can be taken twice, for up to three HMC units of credit. It is not a cs-major elective.

Available for full- or half-course credit.|#|CSMT181A JT|^|Discrete Differential Geometry|^|HCSM|^||^|HM|^|In this course, students will explore how fundamental geometric concepts, such as curvature, can be understood from complementary computational and mathematical points of view. This dual perspective enriches understanding on both sides, and informs the development of practical algorithms for working with real-world geometric data. Along the way, we will revisit important ideas from calculus and linear algebra, emphasizing a visual understanding that complements the more traditional algebraic treatment. The course provides essential mathematical background along with real-world examples and applications. It also provides a short survey of recent developments in digital geometry processing and discrete differential geometry. Topics include: curves and surfaces, curvature, connections and parallel transport, exterior algebra, exterior calculus, Stokes theorem, simplicial homology, de Rham cohomology, Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, conformal mapping, finite element methods, and numerical linear algebra. Applications include: approximation of curvature, curve and surface smoothing, surface parameterization, vector field design, and the computation of geodesic distance.

Raqs Al Sharqi is an introduction to a non-western tradition of dance improvisation, generated in a social dance context, but stylized and expanded to become a stage form primarily in Egypt and Lebanon throughout the 20th century.  The less stylized forms are known in Egyptian dance training communities as Raqs Baladi (dance o the homeland - a social form that is sometimes staged), and as Shaabi (which translates to popular dance).  Each of these also are names given to musical styles, and we will use music from these and other styles to train in the Sharqi style.  This class requires no previous dance experience, and is designed to enhance the student's creative and physical awareness, and familiarize you with the basic movement vocabulary used in this dance form, and with the musical forms utilized in performance.  Classroom activities will also include exercises and information on body alignment, muscular development, and effective breathing/relaxation techniques.|#|DANC091  SC|^|Raqs Al Sharqi I|^|SDAN|^||^|SC|^|Raqs Al Sharqi I - (Egyptian Style Belly Dance)

|#|DANC134  SC|^|Movement as Culture|^|SDAN|^||^|SC|^|This course focuses on exploration of social, folk, and stage dances from Egypt, the Levant(common to Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine), the Khaleeg (Persian Gulf), Morocco, Iraq, and Turkey -- sources for what in the US is known as belly dance. Through readings we will address questions that histories of colonialism and concerns around the performance of race, gender, and sexuality bring to the global spaces of performance and circulation of these dance forms. Readings draw from Dance Studies, Anthropology, Post-Colonial/Decolonial Studies,Dance Ethnography, and first person acounts written by dancers, complimented by video and sound objects. We will investigate the concepts of Orientalism, authenticity, transnational feminisms, innovation in dance, Western vs. Eastern understandings of virtuosity in movement, cultural appropriation, sexuality and gender in dance, and the politics of representation through dance. The course will be 70% reading/writing; 30% movement/practice.

New forms emerged such as modern and postmodern dance, butoh, styles of professional folk dancing that first developed in Eastern Europe and classical Asian traditions that had never been presented outside of the courts in which they had developed. In addition, the 19th century saw the beginnings of Broadway musicals, and the 20th century the development of dance for the movies, and later television, which dramatically increased the demand for dance performances. The course will look at the ways these various professional dance genres have developed and the role they play in the concert scene today.

|#|DANC139  PO|^|Dance, Ethnicity, Nationalism|^|PTHD|^||^|PO|^|In the United States, and generally in Western Europe, most individuals think of dance in three ways: 1.  A social activity such as a school dance or dancing in a club, 2. A form of entertainment as in a Broadway or Hollywood musical or a television program like "Dancing with the Stars," or 3. A form of artistic production like Giselle or choreography by Martha Graham. In this class we will look at dance in a different way. We will look at dance as a vehicle for achieving political goals, for representing the state, for building ethnic identities, for demonstrating national pride. We will first conceptualize the idea of dance as a political vehicle and then we will look at specific examples: Irish step dancing, Ukrainian and Russian folk dancing, the Hawaiian hula, the Argentine tango and Turkish folk dancing, among others, all of which have served regimes of various political stripes.|#|DANC140  PO|^|Beg Creative Movmnt Exploration|^|PTHD|^||^|PO|^|Composition I.

Texts exemplifying feminist ethnographic methods in dance and performance studies explore intercontinental connections through media, geography, and collective aesthetic and political impulses. The ethnographies we read, focused on performance broadly construed, represent feminist research concerns and methodologies of women of color.  Additionally, through case studies we approach topics addressed by feminist artists in their work (blackness, passing, environmental concerns, sexual violence, lesbian identity, immigration, disability, among others). We will train in feminist theory and methods in critical performance ethnography, and engage in thoughtful performance making and criticism. Prerequisite: Sophomore standing.

Food
connects us to one another, to our families, cultures, and histories. It is a major part of our economy - every day of our lives is
impacted by food system workers. Today, the increased availability of cheaper food, larger portion sizes, the reliance on high calorie,
processed ingredients, the types of food available in many communities, government policies, and lifestyle choices have led to an
epidemic of food-related health problems. At the same time, many Americans struggle with food insecurity due to wage stagnation
and economic disruptions. Food systems are both major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and are particularly vulnerable to
climate change. The sustainability of human civilization hinges on the resilience of our food systems. In this course, we develop an indepth understanding of food systems - the people, processes, and resources that move our food from farm and ocean to plate.

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) act as the unseen infrastructures for gathering, managing, and analyzing data that is or can be mapped, that is connected to some part of the world. GIS can be applied broadly in multiple domains to create maps that guide policymakers, businesses, communities, and individuals to make important decisions.  In recent years, these tools have increased in sophistication allowing us to model complex socio-spatial relationships while simplifying the processes involved with easy-to-follow drop-down menus and an increasing array of off-the-shelf plug-ins for mobile and desktop applications. Collectively these transformations have enabled an expanded user-base to enter the world of map-making. Yet, how do we ensure that these tools are (re)oriented toward the ends of creating a more ecologically and socially just world? In this course, you will develop a solid foundation on the commonly used processes for creating static and interactive maps that reflect hidden inequalities and disparities; as well as highlight hopeful imaginations of a more just world. In order to reach these aims, this course takes a student-centered approach, grounded in critical pedagogies and anti-racist frameworks. Students will work with the instructor and their peers to develop a collective model of engagement that values the contributions of all classroom participants and allows for an individualized assessment of growth in developing fluency of the complex mix of technological tools and theoretical understandings that undergird GIS.This course will provide an introduction and overview of GIS; specifically, ESRI WebGIS and ArcGIS mapping software; to demonstrate the basic analysis of spatial data for those interested in answering questions about the spatial significance of environmental justice, racial inequality, hazard exposure, and health equity.

The course is structured to focus on different types of systems separately, e.g. streams, lakes, wetlands and estuaries while demonstrating that many of the same ecological processes and phenomena occur in each, i.e., biogeochemical cycling, controls on primary production, evolutionary selection, community patterns, population dynamics and food web structure. The most visible taxa in aquatic systems will be introduced including algae, plants, fish, birds, amphibians and reptiles via laboratory and field work. The course will discuss how drinking, irrigation, recreation, transportation, flood control and power generation compete for water resources, altering the ecology of inlands ecosystems. Case studies will integrate ecological sub-disciplines while highlighting the human-nature conflicts in freshwater systems. Students interested in watershed and marine systems will find the course extremely useful in their understanding of how various biota co-exist in these seemingly simple systems. There will be two weekend field trips for the course. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: BIOL041E PO or EA 030  PO plus one lab course or CHEM001B PO or one semester of statistics. May be repeated twice for credit.|#|EA  174  JT|^|Building Los Angeles|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|This course explores the complex network of urban communities in which we live in order that we might think more deeply about the relationship of the built to the natural environment. To complicate our conceptions of Los Angeles, we consider the city's history and infrastructure and examine the social stresses and environmental pressures that result from planning decisions. We also focus on Southern California architecture and design as a profound expression of the relationship between the built and the natural, including new urbanism and the maturation of green design. As a required experiential component, the course features a substantial number of Saturday field trips. $50 fee to cover transportation costs.|#|EA  180  PO|^|Green Urbanism|^|PEVA|^||^|PO|^|A discussion-based seminar restricted to EA majors.

|#|ECON089A PO|^|Mechanisms Social Universe|^|PECO|^||^|PO|^|From the origins of life to the formation of modern civilizations, there have been several recurring themes on how agents interact. In the course, we will study fundamental forces that drive sociality at multiple levels, from viruses to markets. We will uncover some of the hidden mechanisms that rule our social universe. For example, we will discover why genes form chromosomes, why people form nations, and why the reasons for the two are similar. The emphasis will be on a few key ideas that have broad and profound application. In our journey, we will learn from where social systems evolved and perhaps to where social systems may be evolving. Additional time will be devoted to professional self-examination and prioritization.|#|ECON091  PZ|^|Statistics|^|ZECO|^||^|PZ|^|An introduction to the statistical tools used in the quantitative

Have you ever wondered how health insurance works and why Health Insurance is a good thing but why so many people are uninsured or what happens when someone cannot afford health insurance? Have you ever wondered why there are so many disparities in health by race and income or why health is better when the economy is flourishing than in a recession? Did you know that African Americans, Native Americans, and Latinos are more likely to die from COVID-19 than individuals who are white? Have you wondered why that may be and what can be done about it? Have you ever wondered whether economics might provide insights into how to address the number of people with behavioral health or mental health issues? Have you wondered what is being done to address those individuals whose mental health has deteriorated due to COVID-19? Have you ever wondered whether economics could be used to reduce the number of people who smoke and vape and thus threaten the health of themselves and others??

The economic analysis of politics, also known as public choice or political economy, presents a coherent analytical framework to tackle these puzzling questions. It starts with the observation that individual motivation in politics is not fundamentally different from the motivation of market participants. Therefore, economists can apply their analytical tools to analyze the behavior of political actors. With the rise of behavioral economics, economists have started to apply models of bounded rationality to the study of political processes. This course will cover the standard rational choice approach and end with a discussion of current research topics in behavioral political economy. The course comprises four parts: (I) normative foundations (ethical theories, collective goals, Pareto concepts); (II) social dilemmas (externalities, coordination failure, commitment problem); (III) possibilities and constraints of public policy (strategic adjustment, dynamic inconsistency, special interests); (IV) current issues in behavioral political economy (populism, the role of the media, irrational voting). The course will not discuss politics institution by institution. Instead, the objective of this course is to develop some habits of mind that enable the students see the world of politics through the analytical lens of economics.

Microeconomic models are used to analyze individual and household decisions regarding demographic behavior, including fertility, marriage and family organization, human capital investment (health and education), migration, and labor force behavior, as well as many factors that influence or are otherwise related to these outcomes.  We will examine causes and consequences of changes in human populations (e.g., size, age structure, gender balance, health, wealth) using an economic framework. Causes and consequences of variations across time, space and subgroups in fertility, mortality, family structure, human capital investment, labor force involvement and migration will be considered, as will impacts on populations and subgroups of natural disasters, wars, pandemics, macroeconomic events, government policies, technology change, and changes in human longevity.  Demographic and economic data for a wide variety of countries are used to demonstrate the interaction between economic and demographic change at the macro level.  We will analyze implications for public pension systems, health systems, economic growth, the environment, inter-group conflict, and government budgets.

|#|ENGL010  PO|^|Introduction to Close Reading|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This course will focus on the central method of literary criticism known as "close reading."  Close reading begins, not with the question, "What do these words mean?" but instead, the question, "What do these words say?"  And then, "What if these words mean just what they say?"  And then, "What would have to be true about the world in which this poem or story operates in order for these words to mean exactly what they say?  Through our iterative encounter with these and related questions, we will consider how literature compels us to revise what we know, or think we know, about the world and how it operates.  It is the central argument of this class that close reading allows us to understand poetic and fictional worlds according to their discrete and unique logic; it is the political gamble of this course that close reading the worlds of fiction and poetry permits us to see 'this' world-the actual, real, or historical world-in its capacity to be otherwise.  Readings will range from Isabella Whitney, George Herbert, and John Donne to Shirley Jackson, Aimee Bender, and Carmen Maria Machado.  We will watch a few films (Hitchcock's Rope and Lamorisse's The Red Balloon) and we will read example of close reading from the visual arts (e.g. T.J. Clark).  |#|ENGL010  PO|^|Introduction to Close Reading|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This course will focus on the central method of literary criticism known as "close reading."

We will consider artistic movements such as the Harlem Renaissance, the Black Arts Movement, Spoken Word, Hip Hop, and "Post-Soul Poetics". Since a definition of racial identity is complicated and multifaceted, it is important to begin with an understanding that the African American poetic voice is not monolithic. In terms of a poetic tradition, however, one could argue that the history of social and political struggle (Abolitionism, Civil Rights, Black Nationalism, Black Feminism, LBGTQ rights, and Afrofuturism) established an artistic continuum. This tradition is shaped by intimacy, a desire for justice, joy, transcendence from suffering, and the simple and complicated wish to be free. We will discuss religion, visual culture, politics, dance, music, and comedy. Rather than reduce African American poetry to a timeline, we will follow the echoes of history, analyzing how voices and themes overlap.|#|ENGL047  PO|^|The Literature of Gambling|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|Narratives of gambling-in which the arc of a life may seem to depend on a roll of the dice-in comparative perspective, with an emphasis on various concepts for thinking about an unknown future, including fate, divine intervention, luck, hazard, chance, speculation, risk, and accident.

In this course we will consider how the gothic genre made its way into the writing of numerous 19th century American authors, such as Charles Brockden Brown, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edith Wharton, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Moreover, we will consider how the history of slavery and indigenous removal influenced the formulation of American gothic tropes, such as the shadow, the haunted house, psychological turmoil, and fear of the unknown. Finally, we will read from contemporary African American authors such as Toni Morrison and Octavia Butler, whose neo-gothic texts reimagine what haunts American literature.

This course takes up that poem's iterative, almost compulsive, attempt to capture the very moment at which one "body" ceases to be itself by transforming into something else. Tracing Ovid's narrative scenes, including the myths of Apollo and Daphne, Echo and Narcissus, Actaeon, Philomela, and Pygmalion (to name a few)  across centuries of retelling, refashioning, and reimagining, we will ask: How does one body, one constellation of matter, assume another shape? What is the relation of the human body to the plants and animals and minerals that it can become? How might the design concept of "affordance" encourage us to rethink the capacities of form? Most importantly, we will attempt to answer these questions through two distinct, historically competitive, but mutually generative modalities of inquiry: the verbal and the visual. Co-taught by a literary critic who specializes in poetry and poetic theory and a painter who specializes in figure drawing, course readings and assignments will move across these fields, requiring students to both analyze and create, write and draw, describe and make. Possible topics include: the temporalities of verbal and visual arts; ekphrasis (or the verbal depiction of the visual arts); enargeia (or the "vivid" style of language); the blazon (or the piecemeal depiction of the human body); human and post-human; psychoanalytic and feminist theory; history and philosophy of science; theories of form; bodily violence and the aesthetic; the fragmented body; abstraction as a strategy for defying categorization; perversion and developing a moral discourse on perception.|#|ENGL061  PZ|^|Literature of the Supernatural|^|ZENG|^||^|PZ|^|This course investigates

Touching down at key moments in the development of the imagined and actual West, we investigate a variety of supplementary discourses fueling nineteenth-century westward expansion and settlement (e.g. empire for liberty, manifest destiny, gold rush) and their perpetuation and evolution in the twentieth century (e.g. closing of the frontier, Hollywood, Route 66). Texts range from the travel narratives of Lewis and Clark and Mark Twain to the social protests of John Rollin Ridge and Maria Amparo Ruiz de Burton to the modernist experiments of Nathanael West, Joan Didion, and Don DeLillo. Through this broad survey of western American literature, students encounter a variety of voices competing over the symbolic and the manifest representation of a highly coveted territorial space.

Literary translation forms the basis of most readersâ acquaintance with world literature, yet there
exists a wide spectrum of beliefs among practitioners regarding the ethics and politics of
bringing one language into another. This course provides context for current debates and
controversies surrounding the theory and practice of âtranslationâ: a word that, in English,
literally means âto carry across.â Centering contemporary BIPOC writers and translators, we
examine and emulate how translation in the 21st century problematizes traditional approaches.
Through forms of creative and scholarly inquiry, we will act as translators attentive to the
following questions: Who is being translated into English today, and why? How does translation
mediate the encounter of distinct cultural contexts and colonial histories? What role does
translation play in resistance and projects of emancipationâor assimilation? How do processes
of translation reconfigure existing power relations, particularly when the target language is
Englishâthe colonial language of finance capital and militarized geopolitical power? How is
translation constrained by institutions, long-standing narratives surrounding market demands (or
lack thereof) for literature in translation, and stereotypes based on national and/or racialized
identities? How do translators work around these constraints, individually and collectively? What
new possibilities do digital technologies and media offer translatorsâand global readerships?
This course is both theory and praxis based, and there will be an emphasis on how culture(s), in
addition to language(s) get translated. Though having some previous background in a language
other than English is welcomed, it is not necessary to participate in the course|#|ENGL074  PO|^|Rise of the Novel|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|The British novels 'rise' from miscellaneous beginnings to the genre that now dominates literary production took place through a series of eighteenth-century narrative experiments.

In this seminar we will examine how archaic "techniques of ecstasy" survived, more or less underground, into the European Middle Ages, as well as inquire more generally into the nature and status of inebriation, poisoning, and visionary trance states. To be considered: love potions in medieval romances; the relations between mystical experiences and plant-derived ecstasies; the use of hallucinogens (mandrake, belladonna, etc.) by "witches"; the history of medicine and alchemy; dream visions and astral travel; the pursuit of stupor.

This world literature course will survey global Anglophone fiction, with a focus on coming-of-age stories. We will study the genre of the bildungsroman (German for novel of education or novel of formation) in postcolonial fiction, with attention to the ways the genre is adapted or modified, and we will assess the utility of child narrators to comment on socioeconomic conditions and historical events. We will analyze childhood as a historically-contingent category, and we consider the ways that postcolonial contextsincluding economic, historical, cultural dimensionsshape the development and integration of the individual protagonists of these formation texts.|#|ENGL098  PO|^|An Art of Noticing|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|When Icarus dies in Brueghel?s painting Landscape with the Fall of Icarus (1560), nobody notices.  That?s what art gets right about suffering, W.H. Auden says 400 years later: we ignore it; we don?t notice. This is a course in a literary form that tries to notice, to show us what we can?t see, or at least that we cannot see. What desire, what longing, what pain escape our ability to represent? How can we use the form of the essay to gesture toward what is missing, what cannot be represented? To explore these questions, we?ll take up a form of writing called ekphrasis: the verbal representation of a visual representation. Ekphrastic essays use the essay?s inherent doubt, play, and critical force to ask what goes unnoticed, to demand we look again, look harder. We?ll read Walter Pater on the ?vampiric? Mona Lisa and Virginia Woolf on war photography; watch Derek Jarman?s ekphrastic film on AIDS, sexuality, death, and the color blue and John Akomfrah?s ?cine-essays? on colonial brutality, human trafficking, climate disruption. Projects include writing ekphrastic essays and trying out multimedia ekphrases (photography, film, digital).   
|#|ENGL099  PO|^|The Idea of the Renaissance|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|The term "Renaissance" is largely taken to identify a period of radical innovation in humanist arts and letters, one that begins with the rediscovery of old, lost, forgotten, and discarded things. Though the chronological borders of that period shift from region to region (i.e. Southern to Northern Europe), it is generally a given that the period of time it designates is now closed. But what if the Renaissance is best conceived, not as a historical period, but as a historical project?  What if the task of the reader is to understand the Renaissance as what Hans-George Gadamer called an  "unfinished event?" The Renaissance so conceived is an idea that we might revive, revise, or redirect. The scholarly mode that it solicits is participation. This course will harness the core insights and innovations of the English Renaissance in order to imagine alternatives to modernity, the present moment, and the imminent future. Topics may include: human, nonhuman, and quasi-human; utopia, dystopia, and worldmaking; the abundance of language; metamorphosis and transformation. Written work will draw largely on exercises of the Elizabethan schoolroom, including: commonplace books; imitations, emulations, and adaptations; exercises in impersonation; and two essays. We will focus on works by Renaissance poets including Francesco Petrarch, Edmund Spenser, and William Shakespeare but we will also reach backward to poets like Ovid, and forward to writers including Oscar Wilde, Franz Kafka, and Jorge Luis Borges.|#|ENGL099A PZ|^|Holocaust Lit|^|ZENG|^||^|PZ|^|Literature of the Holocaust

The Holocaust is often positioned in artistic terms at the limits of representation. Yet no other historical event has been represented more often - in every imaginable medium - than the Holocaust. This course will explore the different ways in which the Holocaust has been represented in the literary medium, from autobiographical memoirs to fictionalized accounts to graphic novels. Texts may include The Diary of Anne Frank, This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen, Survival in Auschwitz, Maus, Jacob the Liar (book and film), The Shawl and Still Alive.|#|ENGL101  SC|^|Readings in British Literature|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|This course provides an introduction to British literature through in-depth readings of significant works from British literary history, with a particular focus on the centuries before the Restoration.

Both partaking of and radically departing from the morefamiliar genres of epic, tragedy, and comedy, early modern "romance" has been described as the'kitchen sink' of literature (e.g. anything, everything goes) and it has been decried as a dangerouswaste of time. What would it mean to think of "romance" as a mode or instrument of inquiry, a tool of epistemology, a form or set of forms with which writers and readers of the early modern period came to know the world as it was, as it might be, and as it should be?  Topics include human and post-human; affective landscapes; allegory; transformation; gender and sexuality.|#|ENGL102  PZ|^|Aliens & Citizens|^|ZENG|^||^|PZ|^|Aliens and Citizens: Narratives of U.S. Immigration Law

|#|ENGL142  PO|^|Literature and The Commons|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|How to Live Together: Literature and the Commons December 1976, philosopher and literary critic Roland Barthes watches a mother pulling her young child, who cannot keep up, along a walkway. He is struck by the scene; he makes a note of it: "she walks at her own pace, unaware of the fact that her son's rhythm is different." A year later, the scene inspires the first of his final lecture courses, which he called "How to Live Together: Novelistic Simulations of Some Everyday Spaces." At the heart of the course was Barthes' concept of idiorrhythmy, a monastic term, the idea of "individual rhythms" that exist-nonetheless-in and with a sense of community. To explore this idea, he turned to literature. This course will do that also. We will take up Barthes' notion of idiorrhythmy and expand it into broader interdisciplinary theories of the commons: "spaces, experiences, resources, memories, or forms of sharing and living." How does literature, we will ask, offer us ways to think about common spaces and experiences, about individual rhythms and efforts (and their failure) to bring those rhythms into community? Literature is also a commons: we'll consider literary form, aesthetics, and poetics even as we look to literary representation, to "content." Our literary focus will be literature in Britain from roughly 1700-1900, the period in which the Enclosure Acts took enormous common swaths of land and privatized them, the period in which rampant colonial ambitions, rising industrial capitalism, and rapid urbanization altered permanently the global landscape of common spaces and resources. Our theoretical reading, however, will range far more broadly: work on the commons moves across economics, politics, ecology and biology, aesthetics, philosophy, sociology, and, of course, literary and cultural theory. Literary authors may include: Daniel Defoe, Oliver Goldsmith, Mary Shelley, Margaret Cavendish, Olaudah Equiano, Christina Rossetti, Mary Wollstonecraft, Percy Shelley, William Wordsworth, Charlotte Smith, John Ruskin, E.M.|#|ENGL142  SC|^|The Early American Novel|^|SENG|^|23.0101|^|SC|^|This seminar explores the development of the novel in the United States before 1850 with particular attention to the early national period. The course will focus on the relationship between the novel and early American political culture, considering how the novel's emergence in the US both shaped and was shaped by contemporary debates about democratic governance. We will consider the rise of the novel in the US in relation to the widespread anxieties about fiction, worries about transgressive sexual behavior, debates about female education, competing theories of national history, discussions of religious difference, and the struggle over slavery. |#|ENGL143S SC|^|Antebellum Lit & Pop Culture|^|SENG|^|23.0101|^|SC|^|The years preceding the Civil War saw both the emergence of a distinctive national literature in the US and the rise of mass consumer culture.

The course will attend to such issues as the emergence of modern social movements, the explosion of writing by and for women, and the popularity of gothic and sensational fiction in the penny press. Readings will encompass both "classic" American literature and the ephemera of antebellum print culture.

We will examine discussions and scholarship regarding Asian American poetry and poetics that have deepened in the last twenty-five years.  In addition, the course will engage with the emergent and established communities that have formed by and for Asian American poets from the mid-twentieth century to the present. This class will also examine and situate the work of Asian American poets as located both inside and outside a mainstream white culture. We will explore the poetry and poetics of Asian American poets from the second half of the twentieth-century to contemporary twenty first-century poetry, particularly following three categories of poetic form: narrative, lyric, and nontraditional writing.  This focus on form will include work off the page, performance, spoken word, and avant-garde work. Not only will the course explore multifaceted traditions in poetry but we will also look at both the theories of categorization and the politics that are always at stake for the poetries and poets. Letter grade only.|#|ENGL146S SC|^|Theory of the American Novel|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|This course offers a history of the development of the novel genre in the United States. The main focus of the class will be reading significant American novels from the 1790s through the early 20th century. The class will examine how these novels both participated in and were shaped by various social, political, and cultural developments of the long nineteenth century, including(among many others) the contest to define democracy in the early republic, the explosion of writing by and for women in the 1840s and 50s, the antebellum struggles over slavery, and the rise of modern social movements. The class will also consider writing about novels-from both 19th-century writers and later scholars-giving particular attention to accounts of what distinguishes "the American Novel" from other national traditions, especially the English novel. It will also consider the limitations of accounts that understand the development of the novel in such national terms. In addition, this course will offer an introduction to the subfield of 20th and 21st-century literary theory known as "theory of the novel." We will both consider how these theories of the genre illuminate the novels that we are reading and consider the ways in which these grand theories of the novel cannot account for the genre as it developed in the US.

Readings focus on the eighteenth, nineteenth-, and early-twentieth centuries and include works by U.S. authors of African, Asian, Indigenous, Latinx, and SWANA (Southwest Asian and North African) descent. The course pays particular attention to the various ways literary scholarship has engaged with U.S. writers situated at literal and figurative borderlands and/or writing from hybrid identities.|#|ENGL150  PO|^|Visual Poetics|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This course will explore the rich and overlapping ways to read poetry and examine visual, performative, intermedial, artist's and textual poetics. We will examine how the term poetics derives from "poiesis", or "active making," and how both poetry writing and art making create textual and visual phenomenon. We will read 20th and 21st century poetry; we will discuss art works, installations, social practice and community-oriented public work. We will also write poetry, create artist books, visit our local galleries and museums, and meet with poets and artists who collaborate on art projects that push the boundaries of art and text.

We demand proof; we conduct experiments; we test everything: nuclear weapons, pregnancy, drugs, IQ, DNA, HIV and everything else. This, we think, distinguishes us from our medieval forebears. Still, what is more characteristic of the Middle Ages than their regimes of proof?--trial by ordeal; the test of a hero in a quest; demonstrations of the number of angels on the head of a pin. The purpose of this seminar is to see what-if any-difference obtains between medieval and modern experiences of verification. Keeping in mind modern and contemporary work on the experimental disposition of modernity (Nietzsche, Heidegger, Latour, Ronell), we will examine the reality probes sent out by literary, juridical, logical, theological, mystical, and scientific texts from the Middle Ages. To be considered: the failed tests of Perceval and Gawain; disputation and demonstration in the medieval university; Anselm's proof for the existence of God; torture; methods for distinguishing genuine revelation from demonic apparition; early scientific experiments; Ramon Llull's logic machines; the trial of Joan of Arc.

His works have influenced Nobel laureates (Japan), as well as contemporary writers, playwrights, essayists and filmmakers internationally who continue to see in his corpus a guide, artistically, stylistically and ideologically.  The course thus explores the aesthetics and politics of the James Baldwin in historical and contemporary contexts.|#|ENGL159  PO|^|Supernatural Century|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|"Serious century": so one critic characterizes nineteenth-century Britain, understood through its literature. Bourgeois, every day, dour, realistic. Filled with very-long novels about banks and dinners. And then at the window, Frankenstein's creature; a spectral woman in the garden; a hyena with human hands; a revenant nun; a malevolent vampire. This course examines the simmering undercurrents of fear in Victorian Britain through the supernatural beings populating its novels, poetry, short stories, and non-fiction prose. We will ask three questions: first, what is 19th-century Britain-powerful, wealthy, imperial-so afraid of, and why do those fears (of colonial uprising, of modern science, of women's rights, of working-class insurrection, of sexual desire) take shape in literature as reanimated corpses, vampires, specters, immortal libertines, and human-animal hybrids? Second, how do the ascendant literary forms of this era try to manage that fear or, conversely, what literary innovations emerge from the failure to manage it? And finally, we will ask about the changing nature of fear itself in nineteenth-century Britain, from the cathartic fear that complements Romantic sublimity through the disciplinary fear imposed by institutional capitalism to the hysteria, anxiety, and neurosis of late century psychoanalytic thinking.|#|ENGL160  PZ|^|Comparative Borderlands Lit|^|ZENG|^||^|PZ|^|Comparative Latinx Borderlands Literatures:

This course examines âborderlandsâ as analytical spaces from which to interrogate borders as

representations of borderlands within the context of their colonial legacies. Taking a
comparative, transnational approach, we will consider a variety of narratives, poems, films and
performance art pieces to understand the cultural âworkâ borders do in three distinct contexts:
the US-Mexico border; the Haiti-Dominican Republic Border; and the âTriple Frontier,â including
Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil. Reading Latinx and Latin American literature through an
intersectional lensâof racialization, class, gender, sexuality, indigeneity, and citizenshipâour

The act of preserving the voices of oppressed groups, marginalized communities, and social
movements can itself be a form of activism. The Social Movements Collection, held in Special
Collections at the Claremont Colleges Library, made up of various materials from differing social
movements throughout the 20th century is an excellent local example. Holdings include
materials from the Black civil rights movement, Chicanx Movement, the United Farm Workers,
the Young Lords movement, and the Zoot Suit riots in Los Angeles. Items in the collection range
from pamphlets, zines, photographs, banners, posters, programs, art, and tattoo designs. As a
class, and in collaboration with the staff at Special Collections, we will explore what these
holdings tell us about the pastâand our present. Contextualizing the histories of struggle
surrounding the Collectionâs artifacts, we will also ask what sorts of forgotten or occluded futures
they invoke. At the same time, the course will examine literature and other creative forms as an
alternative means of transmitting cultural memory, teasing out how institutional narratives,
ellisions, censorship, and budgetary limitations are addressed and redressed beyond âthe

If the rest of literature is the visible spectrum, the essay, for Edward Said, is ultraviolet light. For Alfonso Reyes the essay contains the possibility of utopia; for Valeria Luiselli and Julietta Singh, it can contain the archive of all we repress or cannot tell. And for Cheryl Wall the essay is a fugitive genre, allowing those who are not free to write freedom. If essays have been compressed and standardized to five neat paragraphs in the U.S. educational system, elsewhere 'throughout history, and across the globe' they are expansive, resistant, creative, subversive. Most of all, they are experimental: they try things out. ('Essay,' from the French verb 'essai,' to try.) Essays are experiments, efforts to say what it is hardest to say, to create 'strange bridges' where there are none. This is a class in a literary form that tries to bridge public and private, world and self, what is and what might be, to bridge what has been suppressed by history and what nonetheless emerges, unbidden, as the resistant possibility that things can change. We will explore the essay in its many varieties and subgenres: the protest and the personal essay, the critical essay and the satirical one, the essay written to reveal and the one written to resist, the essay as it manifests in photography and film and on the internet. We will read essays and theories of the essay from the form's origins in the sixteenth-century to its renaissance in the twenty-first, and from Argentina to France, from Hungary to Mexico, from Nigeria to the United States. And we will write, in different modes (creative and critical, verbal and visual, personal and dispassionate), in order to explore the essay's protean potential to the fullest.

If essays have been compressed and standardized to five neat paragraphs in the U.S. educational system, elsewhere 'throughout history, and across the globe' they are expansive, resistant, creative, subversive. Most of all, they are experimental: they try things out. ('Essay,' from the French verb 'essai,' to try.) Essays are experiments, efforts to say what it is hardest to say, to create 'strange bridges' where there are none. This is a class in a literary form that tries to bridge public and private, world and self, what is and what might be, to bridge what has been suppressed by history and what nonetheless emerges, unbidden, as the resistant possibility that things can change. We will explore the essay in its many varieties and subgenres: the protest and the personal essay, the critical essay and the satirical one, the essay written to reveal and the one written to resist, the essay as it manifests in photography and film and on the internet. We will read essays and theories of the essay from the form's origins in the sixteenth-century to its renaissance in the twenty-first, and from Argentina to France, from Hungary to Mexico, from Nigeria to the United States. And we will write, in different modes (creative and critical, verbal and visual, personal and dispassionate), in order to explore the essay's protean potential to the fullest. Possible authors include Chimamanda Adichie, Theodor Adorno, GermÃ¡n Arciniegas, Francis Bacon, James Baldwin, Roland Barthes, Jose Luis Borges, Frances Burney, Anne Carson, Margaret Cavendish, C|#|ENGL165  PO|^|Theories and Methods in Lit|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|We will focus on a variety of approaches to the study and analysis of literature, as well as conversations and debates within and beyond the discipline.|#|ENGL165  PO|^|Theories and Methods in Lit|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|We will focus on a variety of approaches to the study and analysis of literature, as well as conversations and debates within and beyond the discipline.|#|ENGL165  PO|^|Theories and Methods in Lit|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|We will focus on a variety of approaches to the study and analysis of literature, as well as conversations and debates within and beyond the discipline.|#|ENGL167  SC|^|20th C Jewish-American Literatur|^|GENG|^||^|SC|^|167.  20th Century Jewish-American Literature.
Fluctuating concepts of ethnicity, class, gender, filiation, and religious duty have redefined Jewish American experience in the twentieth century.  This course examines the writing of Jewish American authors as negotiations with the imperative to remember (zakhor) in a "culture of forgetting" that produce new meanings both of "Jewishness" and of "America."

Through readings in legal texts as well as novels by Richardson, Austen, Dickens, and James, we will ask how guardianship intersects with such concepts as ownership, representation, and especially authorship. We will explore the reader's role as ward, and we will glance at guardianship's bearing on histories of slavery, voting rights, and aesthetics, on contemporary problems such as mass incarceration and our failing stewardship of the earth, and on the novel genre's many debts to drama.|#|ENGL170  PO|^|Legal Guardianship and the Novel|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This course examines the guardian as an evolving legal category, as a character populating that 'form for orphans,' the novel, and as a model for the literary persona of the novelist.

Eliot, Ezra Pound, Virginia Woolf, Langston Hughes, Gertrude Stein, Ford Madox Ford, Joseph Conrad, &c--were at the same time brilliant propogandists, creating the aesthetic system by which their works would be enjoyed. They also, along the way, created the first self-concious literary period. In this course we'll read fiction, poetry, and critical prose by the founders of Anglo-American literary modernism, looking at the values it supported as well as those it occluded--the voices it supported and those it made much more difficult to hear. Prerequisite: ENGL067  PO.|#|ENGL170B PO|^|Five American Writers|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|The social sciences have an account of art. What can art tell us about the social sciences? Ralph Ellison worried that sociology would reduce songs, jokes, and stories to culture, and reduce persons to data; his friend Albert Murray simply called sociology 'the folklore of white supremacy.' Hannah Arendt assigned artworks the important task of maintaining a space between individual persons to prevent their collapse into a mass of social stuff. Jane Jacobs believed that economists and city planners fundamentally misunderstood the aesthetic nature of markets and cities. George Kubler proposed to reassign the entire category of artifacts, 'desirable things' that humans make, from cultural anthropology to art history. These five twentieth-century American writers tried to redefine the concept of culture so as to make it useful for art and artists. The goal, in Kubler's words, was to create a kind of renaissance, a 'type of society in which excellent art inevitably and necessarily appears.' Perhaps they lost that argument; the successes of sociological approaches to literature suggest that they did. In this seminar, we will run the test again. We will also consider some examples of social theory by Du Bois, Moynihan, Elster, Fields, and Patterson; some songs, jokes, and stories; and selections from Vico and Tocqueville, two earlier writers who would have loved the social sciences. Prerequisites: ENGL067  PO.|#|ENGL170F PO|^|Herman Melville|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|This course explores Herman Melville's writing across multiple genres from Typee to Billy Budd and including Moby Dick.

Among his works are the first scientific treatise in English, an account of a meeting of birds he happened to overhear one day, a collection of life stories of important women, and a description of a journey to outer space he once took in a dream. But he is most famous for the long poem that we will read in this class. The Canterbury Tales is an interwoven collection of stories he had heard, read, or invented, some of which had come to him from as far away as India. He retells these stories, in a mode of extreme irony, through the mouths of a ragtag band of characters from all walks of life. Chaucer is the first great poet of the English language; he has an astonishingly filthy sense of humor; and his work points the way (perhaps) to a mystical knowledge of the true nature of reality.

But among his other writings are: the first scientific treatise in English; an account of a meeting of the birds that he happened to overhear one day; a collection of life-stories of prominent women in history; descriptions of visions that appeared to him in dreams; and his masterpiece, the finely-wrought monstrosity called Troilus and Criseyde. Characteristic of all of the poet's works is an uncompromising irony; a filthy sense of humor; and, perhaps, a mystical knowledge of the true nature of things. This course consists of an introduction to Chaucer's language (Middle English); advanced analysis of his writings; and research into their modern interpretations. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: ENGL067  PO.|#|ENGL170R PO|^|Testamentary Fictions|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|How does writing fiction resemble making a will? In this seminar, we examine several nineteenth-century novels that offer a last will and testament as a model for their own operations. These works imagine the novel as a harbinger of the author's death and a vehicle for literary immortality. Yet they also explore how those who lack literacy, property, or institutional power may leave marks on their environment. Through close study of such works as the anonymous novel The Woman of Colour, Charles Dickens's Our Mutual Friend, George Eliot's Middlemarch, and Henry James's The Portrait of a Lady, we will consider the role of legal instruments in fiction and the feasibility of imposing one's wishes beyond death.|#|ENGL170Y PO|^|Metaphysical Poets|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|A figure of speech is a twisted piece of language. Poets try to express difficult ideas by folding language on itself, stretching it out, and pushing it around. The metaphysical poets of the seventeenth century compress language to a point of distortion where "heterogeneous ideas are yoked by violence together" in intense, extravagant images. In this seminar, we will study the religious and erotic lyrics of this group of poets, including Donne, Herbert, Marvell, Cavendish, Vaughan, Crashaw, Traherne, Behn, and Rochester.|#|ENGL171S SC|^|The Postcolonial Novel|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|This course will study the formation of a postcolonial canon within English literary studies through examining the form and content of the postcolonial novel. We will query the filiation between the form of the novel and nationalist narratives, as well as how the postcolonial novel has been commodified as world literature for Europe and the US. Additionally, we will attend to the way in which historical and political events from the postcolonial (or neocolonial) era are critiqued or registered. The syllabus will include texts by prominent and outsider voices from Africa, Australia, the Caribbean, and South Asia.

and postcolonial studies-and examines how race, gender, and sexuality have 
been (and continue to be) sites of attempted colonial control, as well as anti-
colonial contestation. We will read canonical texts in both traditions, as well as new literary representations and critical views from Africa, South Asia, and the Caribbean. Students will study novels, poetry, film, and photography alongside criticism that engages nationalism, human rights, citizenship, migration, tourism, and performance.

|#|ENGL173  SC|^|Human Rights & World Literature|^|SENG|^||^|SC|^|This course introduces human rights via the declarations and legal texts that helped shape them, and the fictional texts that have represented and questioned their violations.

However, particular landscapes (the desert, the jungle, the forest), geographies (sub-Saharan Africa, Appalachia, the Pacific Islands), and locations (rural America, and much of the Global South) are often construed as empty or cultureless. In this course, we will study the factors that construct a social and cultural hierarchy of place, and how and why various global ?nowheres? occupy a subordinate position to Western urban centers. We will focus primarily on writing about and from the Anglophone/postcolonial world, and we will query how narrating colonized places as empty, backward, or undeveloped served as part of the political project of colonization itself. We will also consider how domestic spaces are a sort of ?nowhere??where labor is repeated, invisible, and disappearing?and will query how gender contributes to visibility of place. Students will study novels, poetry, and films alongside criticism that engages urban/rural studies and postcolonial theory.|#|ENGL175  SC|^|American Women Poets|^|SENG|^|23.0101|^|SC|^|This course looks at five poets including Emily Dickinson, Edna St. Vincent Millay, and Sylvia Plath. Each of these poets has been extensively written about. We will consider how creativity is affected by culture, personal experience, politics, and artistic convention, reflecting upon the changes in critical appreciation of their work and recent approaches to their poems.  Each student will keep a reading journal and direct one of the classes.
|#|ENGL176  SC|^|Southern Women Writers|^|SENG|^|23.0101|^|SC|^|This course will explore the culture of the American South in terms of women participants.

We'll investigate how women negotiated these conventions within conversion narratives, captivity narratives, novels, autobiography, and essays. We'll learn about the methodologies and theoretical frameworks literary scholars use think intersectionally about how gender and power operate in these texts. And we'll examine how contemporary writers - including non-binary and gender-nonconforming writers - have grappled with this literary history and sought to represent those who couldn't, or chose not to, write their stories down.

In this course, we will read some of the major literary works of this period with reference to various social and historical contexts. How did American authors process the trauma of war in Europe and Vietnam, on the one hand, and respond to the United States' increasing political and economic centrality in a global context, on the other? How did the Cold War and the specter of Communism, and domestic social movements such as the civil rights movement, the New Left, and feminism affect literary history (and vice versa)? How did the formal techniques of modernism give way to postmodernism, and what role did the growth of universities and the rise of creative writing programs play in this process? Readings will encompass fiction, poetry, and nonfiction. Authors may include Ralph Ellison, Gwendolyn Brooks, Flannery O'Connor, Jorge Luis Borges, Allen Ginsberg, James Baldwin, Vladimir Nabokov, Carlos Fuentes, Elizabeth Bishop, Thomas Pynchon, John Ashbery, Joan Didion, Ishmael Reed, and Toni Morrison.|#|ENGL189B PO|^|Introduction to Literary Theory|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|What is literature?

What is an author, and how much power do they have to shape our reading? How, and under what conditions, does literature reflect or intersect with history, politics, sexuality, race, and other social phenomena? These are some of the questions that literary theorists, critics, and philosophers have asked in the 20th and 21st centuries. This course provides a broad overview of some of the major theoretical developments of the past hundred years and serves as an introduction to significant interventions and texts in the literary-critical tradition. Authors may include Viktor Shklovsky, Theodor Adorno, Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, Hortense Spillers, Judith Butler, Paul Gilroy, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and Lauren Berlant.

In a sense, as the literary theorist Catherine Gallagher has observed, novels helped create the modern idea of fictionality, acclimatizing readers for the first time to narratives that were plausible but not truthful. How, then, are we to understand recurrent attempts to produce a 'nonfiction novel' in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries (clustering in the 1960s and 70s, the heyday of the New Journalism, and in the 2010s, the era of 'autofiction')? Should this hybrid form be classified as a species of nonfiction journalism that borrows some of the formal techniques and cultural prestige of the novel, while continuing to be bound by the strictures and standards of factual reporting? Or do nonfiction novels lie closer to the heart of the novel's tradition, given the form's historical origins in a hazy gray area between reality and artifice, fiction and fact? Assigned authors may include Madeleine de Scudéry, Daniel Defoe, Marcel Proust, Ka-tzetnik 135633, Truman Capote, Norman Mailer, Michael Herr, Ryszard Kapuciñski, Danilo Kis, W.G.

Wang's book makes the larger case "that aesthetic forms are inseparable from social, political, and historical contexts when it comes to the writing and reception of poetry." This class extends this lens to multiple genres in creative writing, literature, and performance studies and focuses the class on discussions and readings centered on race, creative writing, and artistic and aesthetic practices.|#|ENGL190  PO|^|Senior Exercise/Seminar Option|^|PENG|^||^|PO|^|Senior Exercise/Seminar Option.

In this fiction workshop, students will explore the ways short stories experiment with  time  and  form.  The  first half  of  the  course  will  look  closely  at  how  and  why  short  stories  use flashback,  compression,  and  other  techniques  to  move  non-linearly  through  time.  Students  will  try  outthese  techniques  in  their  own writing ?first  through  short  exercises,  then  in  a  non-linear  short  story, which they'll workshop with the class and revise. The second half of the semester will explore additional ways contemporary short stories experiment with form, including using lists, fairy and folk tales, quizzes, and other ?found? forms. And for their second short story, students  will try out an experimental form of their own invention. Formerly ENGL194S SC.

What draws writers to particular projects? And what informs writers? choices about the forms  those  projects  take?  In  this  course, we will consider how a variety of contemporary writers have practiced  and  discussed  their  prose  "craft."  We will read  short  story  collections,  novels,  and  memoirs alongside what authors have shared about their process and inspirations. We will discuss how these  books do - or,  perhaps,  do not - bear out their authors' claims  about  how  fiction  and  narrative "work." And we will examine what is at stake, creatively and critically, in writers' reflections on craft, attending to what such reflections reveal about the intersections between the aesthetic, the social, and the creative process.

Here, "queer" describes strange, odd, or uncanny film/video content. It also refers to racial, gender, and sexual representations that diverge from heterosexual, patriarchal, and national representational norms. We attend to strategies filmmakers use to code non-normative depictions despite filmmaking prohibitions. We also consider the role film/video play in facilitating and challenging the late twentieth-century globalization of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender identities. In turn, we develop queer methodologies-reading practices and materialist analyses-to understand how film/video shape and intercept social norms, economic imperatives, and institutions of power. |#|FGSS188B SC|^|Adv Top: Queer Rep Film & Video|^|SFGS|^|05.0207|^|SC|^|This course examines queer representations that intervene into film/video production and consumption.

It attends to how the hemisperic Americas and Asia Pacific regions have been shaped by the United States and China, respectively and concomitantly. We trace overlapping histories of U.S.-European interventions into Asia Pacific, Pacific militarizations, Chinese empire, and modern Chinese nation-state building led by Han ethnonationalisms. Focusing on transpacific crossings and the production of "sinophone cultures" in history, popular culture, science, and tourism, this course applies queer analyses to investigate how the U.S. and China produce one another as analogous "others."

Maigret from the 1930s emerged as the compassionate lawman of the people, Nestor Burma from the 1950s as the ultimate hard-boiled private detective whereas Commissaire Adamsberg, from the 1990s, is the puzzle-solving dreamer. Through a selection of short stories, novel and graphic novels, TV and film, we will examine how French mystery novels explore and construct Gallic wit, personality, and social mores from the 1800s to today. Prerequisite: French 44 or equivalent required. Course is taught in French.|#|FREN127  PO|^|Language & Power in the Fr World|^|PRLL|^||^|PO|^|An investigation of the complex relationship between language and identity in the French-speaking world.

Even though early precursors like Guy-BlachÃ©, were often erased from film history, women directors in France have a long tradition to draw from. It is this tradition of women filmmaking that we will explore in this course, focusing in particular on a new generation of women directors who today are revitalizing contemporary French cinema. Directors studied include: Guy, Dulac, Epstein, Varda, Akerman, Denis, Palcy, Sciamma, MaÃ¯wenn, Benguigui, Braillat, Ducournau. This course introduces students to the art of cinema, its language and techniques, as well as to film analysis. Taught in French with weekly screenings. Prerequisite: FREN044 or equivalent required.

This course is designed around the exhibition "Hélène Berr, A Stolen Life," to be held at the Scripps Clark Humanities Museum, and a significant portion of the course will be spent studying French survivors' audiovisual testimonies. We will be asking what testimonies, in all their forms, do to literature and how literature interacts with other sources.

The war has also been crucial for the development of French culture and society. Indeed, the ghost of the Algerian war still haunts debates about immigration, French identity, the veil and the idea of the French Republic. In this course, we will investigate the ways in which the Algerian war has mediated and possibly shaped debates in literature, films, philosophy, and cultural life in both countries, from the beginning of the war until today.

Available for full- or half-course credit.|#|FRNT112  SC|^|French Film and Theory in Transl|^|SFR|^||^|SC|^|In this semester of French Film and Theory in Translation we will examine multiple facets of crime, in French-speaking contexts. The course asks students to consider how our perceptions of theft, assault, torture, murder and mass murder differ when perpetrators and/or victims issue from subaltern communities. We will further explore the portrayal of crimes committed against and by the state. Films include: Breathless, Hate, The Battle of Algiers, The 400 Blows and Shoah. We will be aided in our discussions by readings of Francophone theory in translation from authors such as: Foucault, Césaire, Fanon, Cixous and Renan.   |#|FS  001  PZ|^|Art in an Age of Protest|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|What is the role of art in our present moment of social upheaval, environmental crisis, and ascendant authoritarianism? Is art essential in an emergency? According to poet, activist, and educator Cesar A. Cruz, âArt should comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable.â Our seminar will focus on the power of contemporary visual art to express and make change. We will visit galleries and museums at the Claremont Colleges, and in the greater Los Angeles area and Inland Empire. Class discussions and assignments will explore how we engage with a work of art through research and writing, and why art matters today.|#|FS  002  PZ|^|All My Relations|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|This course will take an interdisciplinary look at the the construction of family.  We will look at these constructions, through texts in psychology, sociology, literature, culture studies, and gender studies.  |#|FS  003  PZ|^|Graphic Narratives|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Graphic Narratives have been a human activity for millennia, from Lascaux cave painting to the Bayeux Tapestry to WPA murals. A continued maturation of these words and images into what is called a graphic novel has influenced film, television, and theatre despite still being referred to as comic books. Yet the genre has become an important part of visual art and commentary, as read in Maus, Fun Home, Persepolis, and March. Exploring contemporary and historical subjects, students will create narratives, both graphic and literary. Considerable readings and research will be discussed and accompanied by substantial drawing practice and illustration training. |#|FS  004  PZ|^|Behave|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Behave: The biology of why we do what we do

While hiking, you see a rattlesnake. You immediately feel frightened, but shortly later you can think rationally and find a safe path around the snake. Within those few moments, two parts of your brain activated â the first gave the âalertâ signal, and the second helped you make a rational decision. In this course, we will consider the biology behind why humans behave the way we do. Your actions are shaped not only by your immediate surroundings, but also your past experiences, the experiences of your parents, and evolution. How do these different factors contribute to our actions? No prior science experience necessary.|#|FS  005  PZ|^|Food Identity and Resistance|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|African/a and Latinx Food Identity and Resistance

We will examine both African/Africana and Latinx foodways, which were both affected during the Columbian exchange, through both conquest of indigenous people in Las Americas, and the slave trade of African people to the Americas and through the Caribbean.   We will sample three interrelated issues: 1. Food production and consumption, 2. Food identity formation and culture, 3. Food insecurity and ways of resistance, and survival of Latinx and African/a in the United States as it relates to foodways. We start with history to understand the present, so our materials take us back and forth from centuries ago and the present.  |#|FS  006  PZ|^|Nutrition in the Modern World|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|The study of nutrition and food has arguably never been more interesting, due to developments in science and the globalization of food markets. In this seminar, we will trace the history of the human diet to present time. With a cross-cultural lens, we will then explore nutritional issues in the modern world, with a goal of better empowering us to make choices that improve our health and that of our communities and the environment. Books, film, the popular press, and guest speakers will be our sources of information, which we will discuss and write about in various formats.|#|FS  007  PZ|^|Representation Matters|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Representation Matters: Contested Monuments of Public Space 

Over the last decade historical monuments have been called into question by social movements looking to revise colonial histories. This course will look at a diverse array of contested monuments such as the Columbus statue that was recently taken down in Los Angeles as well as transnational counterparts to explore the relationship between historical narratives, monuments, and public space. Specific attention will be given to the diverse interventions that communities have made to tell their story from their own culturally relevant lens and push for popular revisions that center indigenous, campesino, Afro-diasporic, and working-class histories. |#|FS  008  PZ|^|Envisioning Diverse Futures|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Envisioning Diverse Futures, Utopianism, and Social Order 

Knowing and understanding the world through a uniquely Black perspective allows for new and different visions of human possibilities. The possibilities for humankind, social order, and utopianism are examined through the works of visionary science fiction author Octavia Butlerâs Parable, Xenogenesis, and Patternist book series. With climate change, increasing political polarization, and rise of populism across the globe, discussions will focus on how we organize and shape the world around us to ensure a future that is sustainable or altogether different. Students will engage theories across multiple disciplines to practice critical thinking through writing.|#|FS  009  PZ|^|Diversity, Equality & Inequities|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Diversity, Equality, and Inequities

This course will examine questions surrounding ethnicity, race, class, and gender to consider how this diversity has been challenged or accepted in the United States. Students will analyze contemporary and historical issues and explore questions of social justice as they read a variety of fiction and non-fiction texts. In discussion and compositions, students will consider the ways that culture and social structures shape the Pitzer experience, as well as imagining their own roles in transforming society.  This course is the designated First-Year Seminar for students in the International Scholars Program and is open to non-native English speakers only.   |#|FS  010  PZ|^|Reasoning About the Unreasonable|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|"Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.â So sayeth philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. Death. Divine miracles. Nothingness. Creativity. What the minds of others are like (including other animals with senses very different from our own). The nature of the unknown. Conspiracy Theories. One thing that unites this disparate collection of things is that all have been claimed to lie beyond the reach of human reason and the processes of logic. In this seminar, we will see how one might think and write about things that seem to defy or outstrip ordinary reasoning. Is Wittgenstein correct, and if not what can we say of such things?|#|FS  011  PZ|^|Unruly Women of World Lit|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Unruly of Women of World Literature

Troublemakers. Witches. Nasty women. Mad-women. Deviants. This course will explore representations of âunruly womenâ in world literature and pop cultureâwomen who in their unruliness illuminate the politics of gender and behavior, race, sexuality, and class, and around whom discourses of madness, discipline, punishment, and morality dovetail. Our texts will include short stories, novels, films, and essays. Questions weâll discuss include: How do the texts address, critique, and expose notions of femininity and appropriate womanhood? How do characters limn the demarcation between good girl and dangerous woman? Under what circumstances can the attribution of âunrulyâ be embraced, defied, and/or declaimed?  |#|FS  012  PZ|^|Latin American Media Experiments|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Though largely excluded from the histories of avant-garde film, Latin American and diasporic Latinx artists have been producing experimental media for nearly a century.  This history intersects with those of other artforms, with the histories of commercial cinema in the region, and with other international avant-garde art movements.  Interrogating unstable categories and subverting narrative conventions, Latin American filmmakers have long tested cinematic boundaries with works that integrate rigorous formal experimentation and probing social commentary.  Through readings, discussions, and close viewing of diverse films, this course will explore this long history of experimental media arts by Latin Americans and Latinx filmmakers. 
|#|FS  013  PZ|^|Lies + History of Stats|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Lies, Damn Lies, and the History of Statistics

This class explores how quantitative evidence has been acquired and analyzed since the nineteenth century. The intent is to better understand contexts in which basic statistical tools (surveys, visualizations, measures, etc.) emerged and propagated and how social factors continue to inform their use. The course will include primary source investigations of published and archival statistics with an emphasis on how and why data were collected. |#|FS  014  PZ|^|Writing Sound|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|If writing is defined primarily in visual terms, then how does one write about sound?  This seminar takes an exploratory approach to think through and write on noise, voice, the soundscape, sound in media and film, as well as other auditory frameworks to introduce students to ways of learning historically and culturally about sound and listening.  This course will survey wide ranging topics including American and European industrialization, rainforest soundscapes of Papua New Guinea, cassette sermons by Islamic preachers in Egypt, avant-garde music, DJ culture - to name a few. 
|#|FS  015  PZ|^|Women/Political Change in Africa|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Women and Political Change in Africa

Over the past twenty years, African countries have arguably generated the most dramatic increases in womenâs political representation in the world. Rwanda boasts the largest percentage of female legislators, while Namibia, Senegal, and South Africa are among the top 15. Political scientists have sought to understand these developments by analyzing gender quota systems and post-conflict peace negotiations.  This course examines a much longer history of womenâs political engagement, illuminating forms of activism, justice, and social healing particular to African contexts. Students will build an intercultural understanding of womenâs work in religion, state-making, anti-colonial movements, leadership transitions, and advocating human rights. |#|FS  016  PZ|^|Psychology of Cricket|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Associated in the popular imagination with Britain and its former colonies and sometimes baffling to Americans, the 2019 Cricket World Cup was watched by an estimated 1.5 billion viewers worldwide.  This course will introduce students to important psychological concepts in sports psychology and apply those concepts to cricket. We will explore the socio-historical evolution of international cricket.  Second, students will be introduced to various intra- and inter-personal psychological processes related to sport.|#|FS  017  PZ|^|La Familia|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|This seminar explores commonalities and differences across conceptions and constructions of âla familiaâ (the family) for Latinx people living in the U.S.  We will examine la familia from a comparative perspective (contemporary, across different Latinx groups, within families, across immigration status, etc.), and we will consider the psychological, sociocultural, and political factors that contribute to the complexity and diversity of Latinx families.  We will read research and narrative accounts of the journeys that Latinx families have undertaken (in some cases, crossing the U.S./Mexico border and being separated from family members) resulting in the development of transnational ties and evolving identities.|#|FS  018  PZ|^|Unsettling Histories|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|The semester-long project at the center of this writing-intensive First-Year Seminar is working on a Family and Place Personal Portfolio. In the context of ongoing U.S. settler colonialism, students will research their own personal, family and cultural relationships to process of nationalism, settlement, displacement, and colonialism regarding their own hometown or territory. The project asks students to learn and integrate Indigenous historiesof place and people with non-Indigenous and settler histories of place and people, so that the two are seen together rather than as separate. Project writing involves personal reflection, analysis, and representing research findings.  |#|FS  019  PZ|^|Health and the Environment|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Histories of Health and the Environment

What is the relationship between health and the environment? How have humans shaped the physical environment, and how have environmental conditions affected human health and well-being? This seminar explores these questions from a historical perspective. Weâll study the history of anthropogenic environmental impacts alongside non-human, biological processes. Human-induced ecological transformations have shaped patterns of health and disease, manifested in a multitude of dimensions, influencing cultural, social, economic, and geopolitical developments. We will examine the intersection of histories of the environment, health, and disease in diverse global contexts, with an emphasis on the reciprocal relationship between ecological change and human health.
|#|FS  020  PZ|^|Rich Nations, Poor Nations|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|There is enormous wealth and income inequality around the world. Why are some countries rich, and other countries poor? What do we mean by rich and poor? We will begin by looking around the world today to understand this inequality. Then we will go back in time, and seek to understand the causes of disparities in economic development, and wealth distribution among the worldâs nations and regions. We will consider the role of geography, institutions, property rights, economics, politics, history, and culture in explaining different standards of living in different parts of the world.|#|FS  021  PZ|^|Queer & Trans Migrations|^|ZFRS|^||^|PZ|^|Queer & Trans Migrations: Performance, Poetics, Politics

This course introduces key concepts in the field of Queer & Trans Migration Studies through texts, performance and visual artworks, films, music, podcasts, and social media. Students will learn how to write about 1) historical root causes of migration; 2) present-day global politics that have real life-or-death consequences; and 3) queer and trans migrant arts and activism that point towards a future where every being has the right to move freely. While we center our analysis on sexuality, gender, and citizenship, we will apply an intersectional lens that includes race, class, ability, and more. Guest performances will accompany assigned materials.|#|FWS 010  CM|^|Freshman Writing Seminar|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|The First-Year Writing Seminar Program, directed by the Department of Literature, aims to enhance the writing skills and literary acumen of first-year students through intensive composition and revision and the study of significant texts and models.

|#|GEOG105  HM|^|Place, Power, and Difference|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|This course introduces students to social and cultural approaches to space and spatiality. It explores how cultural geography can open up understandings of race, class, gender, sexuality, and other modes of social difference and power. The course critically engages a number of key concepts  space, place, scale,intersectionality, performativity, and orientalism - in leading intellectual debates about place, power, and difference. It will help students develop an awareness of how processes of identity and community formation are inherently spatial, and the significance of the work of social and cultural cultural geographers to political and intellectual struggles around difference.

|#|GEOG125  HM|^|Geographies Disease/Health Justi|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|This course examines the uneven geographical distribution of disease and health, the spatial, social, and political processes that shape that uneven distribution, and some of the ways in which differently marginalized people contest health inequalities and the power relations that generate them. The course introduces a set of core concepts and theories around economic, racial, environmental and reproductive (in)justice, which help to put disease and health into geographical, historical, and political-economic context. It also introduces some of the health justice movements that have sought to address these concerns.|#|GEOG179F HM|^|Geographies of Education|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|To remark that the spaces in which education takes place are changing in the era of COVID-19 is to state the obvious. But what histories and geographies of education do today's transformations inherit? Education has uneven geographies. Schools have uneven access to power and resources, and so do the people who work at and study within them. Why? Drawing on human geography, anthropology, and sociology, this course investigates how the uneven geographies of education express the contradictions of capitalism and white supremacy. It offers students an opportunity to critically investigate the social and political functions of formal and informal institutions of education, and to bring this wide-ranging investigation back to the politics, economics, and geographies of the Claremont Colleges, as well as to their own future spaces of education and educational labor.|#|GEOL015  PO|^|SoCal Earthquakes and Water|^|PGEO|^||^|PO|^|Shifting plates and shifting climate, especially with regards to water, are integral parts of the Southern California setting.

|#|GOVT128  JT|^|The University Blacklist|^|MGVT|^||^|CM|^|Like every age, ours has its dangerous ideas. Hundreds of disinvitation movements have sprung up on American college campuses in recent years to protect students from ideas they might find threatening, offensive, or dangerous. These movements have targeted a broad spectrum of influential intellectuals--from classical liberals like Ayaan Hirsi Ali to leftists like Angela Davis to conservatives like Christina Hoff Sommers. By exploring books by many such disinvited authors, this course explores contemporary contention over free speech, provides a window into the dangerous ideas of our time, and will help students think more deeply about the virtues and costs of censoring them.

|#|GOVT132E CM|^|Pol/Econ of Nat Resource Policy|^|MGVT|^|45.1001|^|CM|^|This seminar course addresses the question of how countries dependent on natural resources ought to husband these resources and invest the proceeds productively. It employs the policy sciences framework to explore the political and economic-policy challenges of minimizing the abuse of resource endowments due to mis-pricing, corruption, intra-governmental conflicts, and perverse governance arrangements. It examines why governments seem to abuse natural resources willfully, what forms of privatization hold promise for better resource use, what fiscal and governance arrangements are optimal for the relationship between government and state natural-resource agencies, and whether resource abundance is actually a "curse" rather than an advantage for a country's economic and political development. The cases will be drawn predominantly from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Also listed as Economics 142.

|#|GOVT143C CM|^|Int'l Pol Economy of Money/Finan|^|MGVT|^|45.1001|^|CM|^|This course seeks to provide students with an overview of several key international monetary and financial policy issues. We will begin with an historical overview of the international monetary system, from the gold standard to the contemporary monetary system. We will then examine how financial globalization affects the national policy autonomy of advanced industrialized countries. Subsequently, we turn to the international monetary experience of developing countries in the global economy, focusing on Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, post-Communist states and Asia, paying particular attention to the causes and consequences of the major financial crises. |#|GOVT145  CM|^|The Social and Global Pandemics|^|MGVT|^|45.1001|^|CM|^|Pandemics are global and social, spreading through global networks but also rooted in a societyâs class, race, and gender inequalities. This course takes the idea that pandemics and public health challenges mirror fault lines of society, exposing biased beliefs about social groups, exposing preexisting health challenges and systemic inequities. Further, health systemâs responses mirror and further complicate existing socio-economic health inequities. This courses, thus, uses a unique lens of public health to learn about how political and social factors shape a variety of global health epidemics: HIV-AIDS, COVID-19, and metabolic chronic epidemics such as obesity and diabetes. We also adopt a comparative policy approach exploring how a variety of countries manage emerging pandemics and whether they address the socio-economic roots of public health crises. A variety of perspectives, public policy, comparative politics, psychology, and biology are explored through guest lecturers and readings.

Technologies have always been central to how states conduct war, cooperate with one another, and rule their subjects, and this relationship continues today. Over the course of the semester, we will consider this connection first theoretically and then in a series of case studies of specific technologies and their political consequences. We will begin with historical cases and then explore in depth how todayâs information-technology revolution is reshaping international politics.
|#|GOVT148  CM|^|Development in Practice|^|MGVT|^|45.1001|^|CM|^|Developmentâ is one of the great intellectual, political, financial, and operational endeavors of our modern global world, and tens of millions of people are active in it, whether as volunteers or as professionals, donors or beneficiaries. This course analyzes the conceptual, policy, and operational debates in the field of international development.

|#|GOVT150  CM|^|U.S. National Security Policy|^|MGVT|^|45.1001|^|CM|^|In this course, we will engage with both theory and case evidence to analyze U.S. national security policy. We begin by examining the concepts of national security and vital interests. How are they defined? Who defines them?? How have they changed over time? We will examine how national security policies are developed and applied. We will explore the ways in which policy decision making involves complex tradeoffs among competing goals and values, and will practice policy decision making ourselves through a policy roundtable session and a National Security Council simulation.
|#|GOVT150C CM|^|Race/Gender/Identity in Intl Pol|^|MGVT|^|45.1001|^|CM|^|This course will expose students to theories of race, gender, and identity as they relate to two of the political science subdisciplines: International Relations and Comparative Politics. Students will deepen their overall understanding of the discipline and the applications of its tenets and theories; develop expertise on a select issue within the topic area; hone their research, analysis, and writing skills; be introduced to the nexus of academia and policy; and receive support and advice from professors and practitioners. Students will also learn to appreciate how each of the readings and guest speakers prioritizes different worldviews, depending on both disciplinary conventions and ideological standpoints. Prerequisite: GOVT020 CM.

|#|GOVT151  CM|^|Maps and Politics|^|MGVT|^|45.1001|^|CM|^|How do maps affect politics, and vice versa? Maps fundamentally shape the way that we see our world and how we interact politically, economically, and socially, but maps are also shaped by political actors, interests, and institutions.

The course is suitable for all students with an interest in the topic. Prerequisite: GOVT020  CM
|#|GOVT154  CM|^|Policymaking in Internatnl Orgs|^|MGVT|^||^|CM|^|This course examines the nature, processes, and implications of official international organizations and their growing role in international affairs.  How and why does multilateralism arise, what are the relationships between official international organizations and the member countries, how do they make decisions, what implications do these processes have on international cooperation and conflict?  The course will focus largely on international economic organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization, but will also focus on mutual security and environmental organizations.|#|GOVT155  CM|^|Continuity and Change in Africa|^|MGVT|^|45.1001|^|CM|^|This seminar seeks to understand deep dynamics of state-building, identity, development, and conflict in post-colonial Africa. The course is also interested in understanding agency -- how people respond to these large processes, and how they find survival, meaning, and opportunity within them. 

Prerequisite: 
At least one other government/political science course, preferably GOVT060 CM, Comparative Politics, or equivalent. Courses in sociology or anthropology also highly relevant.
|#|GOVT156C CM|^|War|^|MGVT|^|45.1001|^|CM|^|This course is a great books seminar on war.  Students would be expected to read one book a week and then meet once weekly to discuss how the text illuminates the use of war as an instrument of politics, the evolution of warfare (perceptions, strategy, tactics, players, and technology), and the ethics of war.

The course begins with an analysis of the Communist system and analyzes the nature of the regime, its sources of legitimacy and sustenance, and the reasons for the system's decline.   The course then examines Russia's post-Soviet period in order to understand the successes and failures within political and economic liberalization.  In this course, we will examine the transformation of political institutions, national identities and economic systems that followed from the collapse of the Soviet system.  While this course reviews the main historical events in Russian politics, the main focus of the course is to evaluate Russian political developments within the context of theories in political science on democratization, national identity, and the role of ideology in political and economic regime change.   The course concludes with a special focus on Russian energy politics and the evolution of Russian foreign policy toward Eastern Europe and the "Near Abroad." Prerequisite: Government 20.

|#|GOVT174  CM|^|Topics in Political Philosophy|^|MGVT|^|45.1001|^|CM|^|A topic of enquiry will be chosen each semester to reflect current challenges and concerns in the field of political philosophy. The topic for fall 2022 is "Xenphon: Politics, Philosophy and War"

Xenophon, like Plato, was a student of Socrates.  Xenophon, however, led something of a more active life, traveling to Persia where he became general of an army of Greek mercenaries fighting to return home. This practical bent is reflected in the Anabasis, describing his adventures in Persia, and theEducation of Cyrus, a biography of Cyrus the Great that inspired Alexander the Great and attracted the attention and admiration of Machiavelli.  Yet Xenophon also wrote the Memorabilia, a work devoted to a consideration of Socrates and his more contemplative way of life. This class will consist of a close reading of these works with particular attention to the  demands of and tensions between the political and philosophic life.|#|GOVT179  CM|^|Law, Order, Justice, and Society|^|MGVT|^|45.1001|^|CM|^|This course considers the ideas of major writers in the field of political theory who have contributed insight into the concepts of law, order, justice, and society.

The course will explore the relevance of these ideas to historical questions and contemporary debates about law, order, and justice within urban communities in the United States, including mass incarceration, police brutality, and abolition.

Prerequisite: GOVT020 CM|#|GOVT182  CM|^|Church/State in US Constitution|^|MGVT|^|45.1001|^|CM|^|Over two hundred years into the American experiment, issues of church and state continue to divide the nation. How far reaching is "the great separation" between church and state? Does it require the development of a secular citizenry? Is it consistent with claims that America is a Christian nation? The vexed relationship between church and state is at the heart of public debates regarding education, marriage, and numerous other issues. To illuminate current debates we will examine the philosophical and political arguments for separation and how these have played out over the course of American constitutional history. Prerequisite Government 20.

As consumers of modern culture's artifacts-paintings, architecture, movies, literature-we tend to be unaware that most artistic and political movements originated in one very specific idea. Em-bodying the quintessentially modern claim to nothing less than the capacity to change the world, the manifesto has captured the urgency of this idea for almost 200 years.
Beginning with the modern era's archetypical manifesteers, Marx and Engels, this class explores proclamations by the abolitionist movement, Italian Futurists, and Riot Grrrl punk rockers. We will discuss declarations by womenâs suffrage activists, Bauhaus architects, the Chicanx Student Movement, Soviet filmmakers, and many other manifestos.  Taught in English.|#|GRMT103H SC|^|Karl Marx: Capital|^|SGRM|^||^|SC|^|This conversation class offers a guided close reading of volume I of Karl Marx? magnum opus Capital: A Critique of Political Economy (1867).

We explore two related (but distinct) topics: how crimes are planned and executed; and how they are then turned, step-by-step, into compelling literary and cinematic storylines. Course and materials are entirely in English.|#|GRMT116  SC|^|The Decadents|^|SGRM|^|16.0501|^|SC|^|The 19th century "decadents" treated art as an intoxicant.

The course will move from the squares of 19th-century Berlin, the grid of Manhattan, to the malls and theme parks of Los Angeles, using fiction (Poe, Kafka, Wm. Gibson), film (Lang, Wenders, R. Scott), essays (Eco, Didion), and urban theory (Sennett, Choay) to investigate how changes in the perception of the city reflect the ways modernity sees itself.

Racial capitalism as a framework recognizes that capitalism is inherently social and that capitalist value production has thrived on the violent and violative production of social and spatial difference and separability. We will learn from interdisciplinary scholars that have asked and investigated how and where categories of difference like race, class, gender, and sexuality are in productive tension with the relations of property, ownership, and capitalist value. We will learn about abolition democracy as a political intellectual model that precedes and exceeds the developmental model of racial capitalism by grounding abolition democracy within Black and Indigenous studies and Gender and Sexuality studies. Abolition democracy is not just a response to racial capitalism and racist violence, but is a way of being and knowing that offers insights to some of our most pressing social concerns.|#|GWS 140  PO|^|Queer Of Color Lit And Theory|^|PGWS|^||^|PO|^|This class will examine the central texts of queer of color (Black, Latinx, Asian American and others) theory, while also studying the novels, poetry and plays of important authors.

In doing so, we examine the queer and crip children and childhoods against which the figure of the Child is articulated.

Students will examine the formation of Asian American genders and sexualities alongside histories of racialization, migration, and labor that span East, South, and Southeast Asian, as well as Pacific contexts. In our engagement with transpacific movements of people and culture, we will foreground settler colonial occupations of the Pacific Islands and highlight the work of decolonial queer-feminist thinkers like Haunani-Kay Trask, Maile Arvin, and Stephanie Nohelani Teves. We will attend to the incommensurability of migrant and indigenous frameworks, even as we move through the persistence and at times concurrence of multiple forms of colonialism that connect Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. Some questions we will address include: How do historical contexts (i.e. the Cold War, 9/11, Japanese internment) affect Asian American gender formations? What does the popular (Orientalist depictions of Asian women from Geisha Girl to Tiger Mom) have to do with the geo-political (U.S. economic relations with Asia)? How might an Asian American queer politics reveal the limitations of the model minority myth? How can centering Pacific Islander onto-epistemologies decolonize notions of gender and sexuality?|#|GWS 162  PO|^|Decolonizing Gender/Sex Asian/Am|^|PGWS|^||^|PO|^|Through an analysis of historical and contemporary Asian American and Pacific Islander literature, film, performance, art, and popular culture, this course emphasizes a wide range of engagements with gender and sexuality that disrupts binary thinking on the topic.

Another goal of the class is to question how contemporary approaches to environmentalism might have arisen out of already limited epistemological frameworks and legal histories. As part of our investigation into the asymmetrical distribution of toxins and environmental fallout across different populations, students will not only grapple with biopolitical theory but also look to a range of cultural texts - from science fiction films to contemporary fiction to graphic art - to consider alternative political assemblages and strategies for survival that arise from gender and ethnic studies frameworks.

The process has had multiple cultural, economic, and political effects on conceptualizations of "sexuality" and its relationship to gender across the world. In this class, we will learn how to situate cultural, and historical understandings of gender and sexuality in their geopolitical contexts. We will examine concepts of identity, sexual practices, and queerness in relation to notions of the local-global, nationhood, the transnational, diaspora, borders, margins, and urban-rural. We will bring postcolonial, decolonial, transnational, queer, and feminist disciplinary approaches to talk to each other, in order to study how knowledge about sex, gender and sexuality is produced and disseminated transnationally.

In this class, "trans" will act as an umbrella (if a potentially insufficient one) for multiple modalities of gender-nonnormativity, including transgender, nonbinary, intersex, and Two-Spirit identities. We will discuss how gender-variance enables contestations of colonial-imperial and racializing ideologies of gender. To these ends, we will center the intersectional dimensions of gender-variance by examining its interlocking and co-constitutive relations with race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, disability, mobility, and citizenship. Given trans studies' critiques of academic disciplinarity and nation-based analytical frameworks, this course will embrace transdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transnational approaches. |#|GWS 185  PO|^|Biopolitics: Sex,Captlsm,Affect|^|PGWS|^||^|PO|^|This course will center on the writings of Michel Foucault as well as his interlocutors and successors to ask about the workings of power, discipline and control in the modern era.

In addition, we will explore the political implications of how the body is theorized. Rather than perpetuating a universalist understanding of the body as ahistorical or demanding an over-determined particularity around the body that neglects forms of relationality, we will seek to balance questions of bodily matter and experience with gestures towards relations to another. We will read scholars such as Hortense Spillers, Saba Mahmood, Michel Foucault, Susan Stryker, Anne Fausto-Sterling, Jean-Luc Nancy, Mel Chen, Bryan Turner and Gilles Deleuze. Prerequisites: GWS 026  PO or FGSS036  SC and one upper-division course in GWS. |#|GWS 186  PO|^|Theories of the Body|^|PGWS|^||^|PO|^|The body has been theorized, understood and controlled in a variety of ways by artists, theorists, politicians, governments and churches, amongst many others.

This introduction to the origin of the modern world focuses on the cultural transferences and translations between Europe and the rest of the world between roughly 1400 and 1815 and the cultural, intellectual, political, religious, and social transformations that shaped these encounters. Historians claim that the distinguishing feature of the modern world is the intensification of globalization, and so we will concentrate on how early modern people experienced transnational and transcultural exchange, attending to systems of power and inequality. Moreover, we will examine how emergent attitudes towards race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality intersected to shape the lives of the figures we study in a period of profound metamorphosis and dynamic engagement between Europe and the rest of the early modern world.|#|HIST070A SC|^|United States History to 1865|^|SHIS|^|54.0101|^|SC|^|A survey of the major social, economic, intellectual, and political developments from the period of colonial settlement to the Civil War.

How do we account for the timing, pace, and geography of European imperialism? Histories of colonialism tend to privilege the enterprises of Spain, England, and France. Yet in the long sixteenth century, the small kingdom of Portugal was one of the preeminent colonial powers, with extensive if dispersed conquests in Africa and Asia, and a burgeoning plantation-colony in Brazil. This course examines Portugal, the Portuguese Empire, and the trans-imperial borderlands as an entrée into thinking about the First Age of Globalization, c. 1500-1800.

|#|HIST124  PO|^|The U.S. in the Middle East|^|PHST|^||^|PO|^|For over a century the relationship between the United States and several nations of the Middle East was defined by mutual benefit and positive collaboration, especially in the fields of science, healthcare, and education. Whereas the people of the Middle East immediately recognized European powers as colonial invaders, they viewed America in a very positive light. However, the century-long positive perceptions gave way to a more negative and hostile view of the US in the Middle East since the mid-20th century. To understand this radical shift in the relations between the US and the Middle East (including Pakistan and Afghanistan), we will study and discuss events, ideas, and doctrines that have shaped the interactions between these countries since the mid-19th century. Along the way, we will examine key issues such as America's earliest cultural and educational engagement in the region, Cold War rivalries, oil, US military intervention in the region since the 1950s and its support of authoritarian governments, Arab Nationalisms, the 1979 Iranian Revolution, and the rise of Islamist Movements.

This course will focus on case studies of genocide and genocide prevention in Europe. How do border changes, nation-state formation, and the collapse and rise of empires trigger ethnic cleansing and genocide as occurred in the Ottoman Empire, the Second World War, and more recently in the post-Soviet conflicts in the former Yugoslavia? Lectures and discussions will delve into specific topics, such as the role of racism, anti-Semitism and biopolitics, the psychological responses of victims, the inclusion of rape as a genocidal war crime, the response of bystanders, perpetrator motivation, and trends in post-genocidal societies such as trials, memorialization and compensation.

Between the 1920s and 1950s, a number of Europe?s fledgling democracies disintegrated
into totalitarian dictatorships. During the past thirty or so years, scholars of modern Europe have begun to question the degree to which these regimes really were ?totalitarian? in their expression of power. This seminar, therefore, is designed to explore the political and cultural histories of twentieth century Europe?s totalitarian regimes, including Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, and others via the analytical lenses of various types of foodstuffs and beverages. Ranging in topics from the production of geneticallymodified strains of wheat to the politics of women?s labor and consumption (public/private responsibilities, shopping and cooking, resistance and non-compliance via eating and drinking, etc.) to, finally, the regulation and enjoyment of alcoholic beverages, we will explore these societies ?from above? and ?from below? by evaluating the degree to which everyday eating and drinking impacted both the construction of these notorious dictatorships and the on-the-ground realities of everyday, quotidian experience. 	|#|HIST138  CM|^|Europe's Total Wars|^|MHIS|^||^|CM|^|This course examines Europe's 20th century as a series of "total wars," from the Great War in 1914, through the Second World War and Holocaust, and concluding with the Cold War. It approaches these wars and genocide as a combination of military, economic, ideological, political, cultural, and social developments. The historical concept of "total war" will be discussed, and its horrific reality in modern Russia, Germany, France, England and the Soviet Union will be studied through the written, oral and visual accounts of political leaders, theorists, and ordinary individuals. Special attention will be paid to the themes of children at war, gendered aspects of warfare and genocide, and memory.

Colombia is home to the second largest Black population in Latin America after Brazil, and Blacks have stood at the heart of its struggles for dignity across the course of the nations history.

Throughout the colonial era (1697 to 1791 in Haiti and the 1520s to 1810 in Colombia), the poor practiced marronage or escape from beneath the control of European slave elites and metropoles. Metaphorically, those who liberate themselves or break free are the maroon nations, the peoples who have built societies based upon egalitarianism and profound respect for the land. Ranged against them were elites closely tied to Europeans, at first, and then to the United States, up to the present.

Black Colombians have won rights to the land that are historic for all people in the African Diaspora in the hemisphere.

This seminar examines academic freedom by probing limits on the
permissibility of speech, especially faculty speech, in US college 
classrooms during two eras: (i) the present and immediate past and (ii) 
the long twentieth century.  Along with examining several case studies 
and reading key texts that make the case for academic freedom, the 
course engages in the praxis of teaching important artistic, political, 
and scholarly works that push, or perhaps cross, the boundaries of 
permissibility for classroom teaching in our own time and place, 
including Joshua Cohen's 2021 novel, The Netenyahus, Radu Jude's 
2021 film, Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn and one or more 
ethnographic texts concerned with social worlds in which normative 
behavior would lead to severe sanctions if it occurred here (on our

This course is an Inside-Out course. Inside-Out courses are regular college courses that are part of the international Inside-Out Prison Exchange Center model that "bring together campus-based college students with incarcerated students for a semester-long course held in a prison." The Claremont Colleges Inside-Out program takes place at California Rehabilitation Center, a level II men's prison in Norco, CA. These courses are slated as "Permission of Instructor Required" so that the faculty members can fully explain the nature of the course and request students to complete an application or interview prior to enrollment. Students should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing (available through Student Healthcare Services for $10), and the need to submit personal information for background checks.

This course examines themes of race, nationality, and citizenship in Black American political thought in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Taught as a reading/discussion seminar, the class introduces students to major movements and debates that contour what is referred to as Black Internationalism. How have Black activists contended with U.S. foreign policy and forged solidarity with liberation movements around the world? How have U.S. understandings of race been shaped by global constructions of race, class, and caste? Exploring these questions, we will engage a dynamic tradition of Black American intellectuals navigating identities as U.S. subject-citizens. Our goals include 1) developing facility with engaging public and scholarly conversations about the role and function of race in contemporary U.S. society 2) nuancing our understanding of the material, social, and political conditions that have linked identity with inequality 3) gaining perspective on race and ethnicity from and beyond the United States. |#|HIST173  CM|^|Global Borderlands|^|MHIS|^||^|CM|^|What are the historical processes that have constructed the porous, contested spaces known as borderlands? Instead of taking a diplomatic or state-centered view of borderlands, we examine social processes of border-making, looking at the creation of hybrid, mobile cultures that often defy nationalist visions of the borderlands and the imagined national community. The course prioritizes a decolonial or anti-imperial approach to borderlands to uncover histories of marginalized peoples who have often been exploited and oppressed related to structures of racism. Course readings focus on borderlands in the Americas in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, although comparative global examples allow students to recognize shared traits of borderlands regions or 'in-between peoples' in diverse contexts. Readings raise issues related to identities such as race, ethnicity and gender, migrations, geographies, settler-colonialism and citizenship. Students develop an original historical research paper using the theoretical and methodological approaches introduced in class. Previous coursework in History strongly advised.

crisis. But why and how is history especially relevant now? Is its lesson primarily instructive, to teach us that the past either repeats itself or is constituted by unique events? Does history provide critical distance to help us reflect on the present maelstrom of political rancor and division?

Where do these diseases start and where do they spread?  But most important: how and why do they spread?  And in what ways does the lived experience of a pandemic influence and become influenced by other social and cultural trends across the globe, particularly in science trends across the globe, particularly in science and religion?  We will consider these questions zooming in on the following case studies: the Plague of Justinian, the Black Death, the Columbian Exchange, multiple outbreaks of Smallpox and Cholera in the 19th century, the Third Plague Pandemic, the 'Spanish' Flu of 1918, Polio, the Asian Flu of 1957, AIDS, and Ebola. |#|HIST197F SC|^|Topics in Historical Study|^|SHIS|^||^|SC|^||#|HIST197G JT|^|Topics in Historical Study|^|SHIS|^||^|SC|^|What else might radicalism mean?

|#|HMSC120  SC|^|Cultural Studies|^|SHUM|^|24.0103|^|SC|^|120. Cultural Studies.
This course is about the emergence of Cultural Studies in Britain and the United States. We will start with Matthew Arnold's "Culture and Anarchy" and work through the early 20th century to the Birmingham School and important European writers. We will also look at the critique of everyday life and identity in American Cultural Studies. A. Long.
|#|HMSC121  SC|^|Cultr,Colonialsm+Postcolonialsm|^|SHUM|^|24.0103|^|SC|^|121. Culture, Colonialism and Postcolonialism.
This course is about culture and the legacy of colonialism. With references to novels and other texts we will define culture and colonialism, and then explore the place of culture in the colonial enterprise. Postcolonialism follows colonialism, or does it? With reference to recent films we will consider how "post" Postcolonialism really is today. A. Long.
|#|HMSC123  SC|^|Philosophy/History of Culture|^|SHUM|^||^|SC|^|This course will focus on some of the major work in post-Enlightenment (19th and 20th centuries) thinking about culture: Kant's Third Critique, Schiller's Aesthetic Education, Arnold's Culture and Anarchy. As well, it will examine later works on the historical development of the relationship between culture and society paying attention to the ways in which culture has shaped the social categories and experience of class, race, nation, and gender.|#|HMSC130  SC|^|Schools of Cultural Criticism|^|SHUM|^|24.0103|^|SC|^|This team-taught course will examine the categories by which philosophers, social scientists, historians, and literary critics have understood culture. Topics may include historicism (the role of history in defining individual experience), the development of mass culture and new media, and post-colonialism. May be completed twice for credit with different topics.

|#|HMSC133  SC|^|Modernity and the Unconscious|^|SHUM|^|24.0103|^|SC|^|Beyond the theme of sexuality, Freud's discovery of repression and the unconscious has been enormously influential in challenging the foundations of modern experience. This course brings Freud's central analytic concepts into conversation with those of the twentieth-century philosopher Jacques Derrida in order to explore how the vision of a mind characterized by the unconscious has profoundly shaped aspects of modern experience. Topics to be addressed: scientific thought, love, death, identity.

|#|HMSC134  SC|^|Found Postcolonial Theory|^|SHUM|^|24.0103|^|SC|^|This course provides an in-depth survey of key foundational texts in postcolonial theory. Students will learn the main tenets of theoretical paradigms advanced by postcolonial theorists and attain proficiency with the terminology of the field (ex. hegemony, subalternity, orientalism, hybridity, contamination, conviviality, etc.) emerging across geographies and disciplines from the 1950s to the present. The course will problematize the relationship of postcolonial theory as a field to discourses in feminist theory, globalization and transnationalism and application of the theories to real-world situations. |#|HMSC135  SC|^|Language, Culture and Society|^|SHUM|^||^|SC|^|135.  Language, Culture and Society.
This course will consider the roles of language in culture and society by considering its functions in the construction of the self, mind, sexuality, gender, class, 'race,' colonialism and postcolonialism.  We will look at both literary and theoretical texts in order to explore the isssues.  A. Crowley.|#|HMSC136  SC|^|Critical Theory & Modern Culture|^|SHUM|^||^|SC|^|This course explores historical and contemporary efforts to analyze and understand the complex relationship between culture and political economy. We will explore the emergence of the concept of culture and the critical discourses surrounding it from the rise of modern industry to contemporary crises. Topics include aesthetics and politics, literary genres, haunting, sexuality, cinema, and fascism.
|#|HMSC138  SC|^|Genet|^|SHUM|^|24.0103|^|SC|^|Among an impressive group of post-World War II European writers, Jean Genet stands out as perhaps the most versatile.  He was, at once, novelist, playwright, philosopher, filmmaker, memoirist, and polemicist. Is this the reason why Genet's works, though lauded by both Sartre and Derrida, today occupy a "minor" position in both the academy and the literate world beyond? Through a close reading of some of his most important texts, this course will consider how Genet deployed and confronted sexuality, family, morality, and nation as interrelated aspects of the operations of inclusion/exclusion so central to modern Western societies. This course is designed for mature audiences. |#|HMSC138  SC|^|Genet|^|SHUM|^|24.0103|^|SC|^|Among an impressive group of post-World War II European writers, Jean Genet stands out as perhaps the most versatile.

It resists categorization and registers different ways of thinking about the world and oneâs place in it; it typcally blends documentary, experimental, and narrative elements into hybrid and subjective articulations. The course aims to combine theorizing the role of the âessayisticâ and the formal analysis of the essay film, along with an informed sense of what the âessayâ does. We explore the possible histories of the essay film and study the relationship among essays, the essayistic, and the essay film through a series of case studies. Readings include work by Virginia Woolf, James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, Michel de Montaigne, Hito Steyerl, and Theodor Adorno. Possible filmmakers include Dziga Vertov, Alexander Kluge, ChrisMarker, John Akomfrah, Harun Farocki, Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino, AgnÃ¨s Varda, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and JaâTovia Gary.|#|HMSC142  SC|^|British Domestic Interiors|^|SHUM|^|24.0103|^|SC|^|This course explores cultural representations of the domestic interior and its relation to identity formation in literature, film, as well as historical and social documents.  The course focuses on British living spaces, from the nineteenth-century bourgeois interior to the modern urban high-rise.|#|HMSC148  SC|^|The Poetry and Science of Sleep|^|SHUM|^|24.0103|^|SC|^|This course looks at ways scientists, social scientists, and artists approach sleep, and at the ways sleep is positioned in various cultures and societies.  It draws on multiple perspectives: neuroscience, psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, immunology, psychoneuroimmunology, endocrinology. Instructor permission required.

Why have we not made more significant progress and what will it take to do so?  In this course, we will use critical theories (including critical race theory, feminism, Marxism, and others) to understand the entangled issues behind this and other persistent inequities.

The purpose of this course is to help fulfill the HMC mission statement more completely by empowering students to be engaged, critical, and civic-minded participants who can positively impact society.

How have urban structures and social group identities changed from early city-states to modern metropolis with sprawling urbanization? What are the "narratives" produced around the city? Italian cities will be studied under the rubrics art history, architecture, literature and film. Taught in English.
|#|ITAL121  SC|^|Italian Fairy Tales|^|SITA|^||^|SC|^|Even though Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Puss in Boots are among the most popular tales on a global scale, their Italian origins remain unknown or unclear to many. This course aims at unveiling the Italian fairy tale and folk tale traditions and depictions of the human condition through the works of authors such as Straparola (c.1480-1557) and Basile (1566-1632), the founders of this genre, who first blended realistic and fantastical elements in their collections. Students will read and analyze fairy tales written between the Renaissance and today in relation to the cultural milieu in which they originated and their adaptations in other genres and literary traditions. While it is true that numerous fairy tales were initially aimed at spreading civic and familial values among children and young adults, we will examine how many also contributed to the construction and perpetuation of stereotypes, gender roles, and discrimination. In this course, we will discuss questions concerning the narratological and literary aspects of fairy tales, the relationship between fairy tales and national identity, and the reworking of older fairy tales and the production of new ones, in regard to contemporary culture and its aspirations and anxieties. The course will end with readings of the latest âfairy talesâ inspired by recent events such as the Mediterranean refugee crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.|#|ITAL123  SC|^|Renaissance Italian Literature|^|SITA|^||^|SC|^|The course, conducted in Italian, introduces students to the history of Italian Literature from the middle of the 14th century to the 16th century focusing on great masterpieces and less known works who have set a milestone in different literary genres and in the circulation of ideas. An interdisciplinary approach to the works of Castiglione, Della Casa, Machiavelli, Aretino, Straparola, Ariosto, and Gaspara Stampa (among the others) will provide further analysis and understanding of the cultural context of the Italian Renaissance, an era that witnessed the birth of the Italian fairy tale tradition, the unique contributions that women made to the early modern Italian society, and a mushrooming of pivotal political ideas and topics such as the relationship between ethics and politics, and the theoretic foundations of the buon governo. Particular emphasis will be given to the interrelationships between literature and other aspects of life in Renaissance Italy, such as politics, religion, social trends, and culture. 
Prerequisite: ITAL044 SC. |#|ITAL124  SC|^|La Cultura del Fascismo|^|SITA|^||^|SC|^|This course will consider the texts, artifacts and documents that have accompanied the rise of Fascism in Italy (1919-22) and explore how these have contributed in creating a culture of Fascism. Students will consider texts surrounding the creation of the movement and party lead by Benito Mussolini, as well as its many forms of opposition we will also read contemporary texts and visual sources to reflect on the remnants of Fascist ideology in Italian culture and society after World War II. Prerequisite: Italian 44 or equivalent.|#|ITAL131  SC|^|Disunification Italy: 1861-1921|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^|his course will explore the history, literature, and narratives surrounding the period from 1861 to 1921, from the Italian unification to the rise of Fascism. Material for class will consist of original texts and artistic expressions from the period, as well as contemporary revisitations of the time. Confronting the different ways of narrating an era, we will focus on themes such as class conflicts, the changing role of women and the family, and the contemporaneous rise of anarchism, feminism, and colonialism.|#|ITAL133  SC|^|Contemporary Italy|^|SITA|^||^|SC|^|This course explores recent trends in Italian literature, film and the arts.

|#|ITAL136  SC|^|Italians as Guests and Hosts|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^|This course examines the phenomenon of exchange between Italians and other cultures.  Through their readings, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of Italian immigrants, who undergo the process of estabishing themselves on foreign soil, as well as those of immigrants from abroad, who seek opportunities as "new Italians."  The course will take into account the changes in attitudes experienced by these guests as well as by their hosts.  Authors to be read include: Erri de Luca, Laura Pariani, Carmine Abate, and Pap Khouma.  Prerequisite:  Italian 44 or equivalent.  
|#|ITAL137  SC|^|Italy as a Murder Mystery|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^|In this course, we will explore in detail all the characteristics of the "giallo" genre and subgenres related to it (such as horror stories and legal narratives), its widespread reception and its inherent multiple textuality, which includes novels, film and comic books. Such texts will open the way to the cultural analysis of the representation of real "gialli," or violent episodes in Italian history that have been on the spotlight for different reasons and in different ways of investigation and have contributed to the formation of Italian modernity.

|#|ITAL141  SC|^|Italian History Through Film|^|SITA|^||^|SC|^|This course will examine the important events that marked Italian history (1861-present) through the analysis of films produced during and/or about those times. We will not concentrate on film history, but rather on how cinema has portrayed history over the years. For this reason, the course will not explore well known materpieces of Italian cinema, but we will instead analyze the impact of less known productions, films made for television or films that were not destined to foreign distribution, in order to analyze how Italian history has been translated in to the popular imaginary. The course will be taught entirely in Italian.|#|ITAL142  SC|^|Italian Cinema & Literature|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^|This course offers an introduction to Boccaccio's Decameron, one of the masterpieces of Italian literature, through a close reading of Boccaccio's collection of hundred tales, an investigation of the literary traditions (tradizioni) that converge in the most important prose work of the Italian Middle Ages, and its cinematic "translations" (traduzioni/tradimenti). During the semester, we will read all the novellas that have been adapted for the screen by Pier Paolo Pasolini (Decameron, 1971), and the Taviani brothers (Magnifico Boccaccio, 2015) identifying the challenges that such a classical Italian work presents to Italian filmmakers in their attempts to transcribe it into an audiovisual spectacle. By reading and analyzing a large selection of Boccaccio's one hundred novelle, and watching and examining their corresponding filmic transpositions, we will address notions and problems of language, style, structure and content for each novella, together with the techniques of transposition of the written text to the movie screen. Prerequisite: ITAL044 or equivalent.|#|ITAL143  SC|^|Contemporary Italian Music & Lit|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^|143. Contemporary Italian Music and Literature.
This course will explore the development of twentieth century Italian music and literature, and the ways these two art forms have interacted with one another. Students will analyze poetry and music in the context of the styles, schools, techniques, and artistic objectives that characterize and inform them. Prerequisite: Italian 44. R. Andreoni.
|#|ITAL145  SC|^|Italian Literature of Gastronomy|^|SITA|^||^|SC|^|The year 2020 marks the two hundredth anniversary of Pellegrino Artusi's birth, author of La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiar bene (1891), the most prominent and famous Italian cookbook in the history of gastronomy. However, the centrality of food and the act of eating have been tackled long before and they have always played a pivotal role in Italian literature, as witnessed by their representations from Dante and Boccaccio to Dacia Maraini and Igiaba Scego. Depictions of food, and the many references to it, in Italian literature and cinema, carry more complex aesthetic and ethical messages that transcend the realm of the kitchen.  Dante's condemnation of gluttony, Collodi's insatiable hungry Pinocchio, Pasolini's La Ricotta, and Ferzan Ozpetek's cinematic obsession with desserts, reveal how food can be a lens through which one can interpret Italy's sociopolitical, religious, and cultural panorama, how it has become a crucial element in defining "Italianess", and how its diversity reflects Italian identity whose dynamic and liquid nature is constantly shaped by its location as a Mediterranean crossroads. We will read short stories, poems, and prose extracts from but not limited to: Dante, Boccaccio, Giulio Cesare Croce, Pirandello, and Marinetti.	
Prerequisite: ITAL044 or equivalent.|#|ITAL146  SC|^|Losers in Italian Literature|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^|This course scrutinizes and reconsiders the concept of losing and its implications by analyzing fictional characters from the Italian short story tradition (from its origins to the twentieth century) who have been addressed as "perdenti, reietti, inetti vinti, sconfitti, and falliti" but who, in the end, have made history in literature by showing how getting lost, losing, and being defeated should carry no shame because, as Umberto Eco claimed, "losers are much more interesting than winners, since they invite the readers to find the reasons for their failure." Course taught in Italian. |#|ITAL191  SC|^|Senior Thesis in Italian|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^||#|ITAL191  SC|^|Senior Thesis in Italian|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^||#|ITAL197B SC|^|The Ferrante Effect|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^|More than a pseudonym masking a secret identity, the name Elena Ferrante has become a force that has traversed geographical borders and challenged literary and social norms. Ferrante, not of immediate success in Italy where her works were originally published, quickly gained international readership with the translation of her tetralogy, L'amica geniale. The effect of Ferrante's international success has resulted in what scholars are coining "the Ferrante effect," an increased attention to works by women writers. In the first half of this course, we will read narratives by and about Elena Ferrante, as well as watch cinematic and serialized adaptations of her work. In the second half of the course, we will explore "the Ferrante effect," reading authors, such as Anna Maria Ortese, Igiaba Scego, and Claudia Durastanti, who have gained or regained recognition through republication or translation as part of "the Ferrante effect." In reading these works, we will question what they have to offer a global audience, what it means to be a "woman writer," and if we can consider "the Ferrante effect" a trans-national feminist movement. Course is taught in Italian. |#|ITAL199  SC|^|Independent Study in Italian|^|SITA|^|16.0902|^|SC|^||#|JAPN001A PO|^|Elementary Japanese|^|PALL|^||^|PO|^|A beginning Japanese language course stressing grammar, vocabulary building, oral and aural communication skills; introduction to the Japanese writing systems (katakana, hiragana and 86 kanji).

This course does not focus on syntactic theory, but instead introduces students to the wide range of grammatical structures that are possible in human language. The course includes overview readings and discussions of broadly attested morphosyntactic patterns. In addition, students will research an individual (unfamiliar) language over the course of a semester (based on existing research on the language) and will present the structures of their chosen language back to the class on a regular basis in both written and oral form. In this way the class serves to introduce students to the range of morphosyntactic constructions in a broad range of the world's languages.

The second half of the course will introduce a new theory that offers an acquisition-based explanation for some core properties of adult syntax. We will read and discuss these new proposals, consider predictions of these proposals, and students will test those predictions using already existing child language data (CHILDES). The expectation is that students will have some background in relevant issues so that everything is not entirely new, and as such a variety of prerequisites are included (with the expectation that students will have taken at least one). But it is unlikely that any student will have background in all the areas that the course covers. Students ought not be deterred if they don't have exposure in some areas that the course touches on: all necessary background will be provided during the course through readings and lectures, including technical skills for using the CHILDES corpora.

All registered students must attend the first class.|#|LIT 037  CM|^|Poetry Writing I|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|This class is an introductory workshop in poetry writing for those who wish to improve their craft as poets while broadening their knowledge of poetry. More than half the semester will be devoted to formal weekly exercises. Poems by students will be discussed in a "workshop" format with attention to the process of revision. Class time will also be spent on assigned readings and issues of craft. Students will be asked to regularly memorize and recite poems. A final portfolio of eight revised poems will be required for completion of the course. Prerequisite: LIT 037 CM or comparable experience.|#|LIT 038  CM|^|Fiction Writing|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|This course, which will be conducted as a workshop, will deal with both short and long forms of fiction.

Throughout the course we will pay attention to how this literature reflects political, religious, and philosophical influences, as well as particular aspects of the early development of the English language.|#|LIT 058  CM|^|British Writers II|^|MLIT|^||^|CM|^|A survey of representative major themes and texts from the Restoration through the early 20th century. The course, which emphasizes poetry, drama, and non-fiction prose, addresses the transitions between Neoclassic, Romantic, Victorian, and Modernist trends in British literature.|#|LIT 061  CM|^|The Bible|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|This course focuses on intensive reading in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, with special attention to the complexities of interpreting a sacred text. The problems of authorship, historical and religious context, canon formation, and translation will be considered in light of the history of interpretation from midrash, St. Augustine, and Origen through modern literary criticism, especially Robert Lowth, Eric Auerbach, Northrop Frye, and Robert Alter. Special attention will be given to the use of the Bible by modern writers. |#|LIT 067  CM|^|Milton|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|England's greatest epic poet was also a political and controversial religious thinker whose life and work had an enormous influence on British and American writers from Blake to Melville. This course will examine Milton's major epic poems - Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained, and Samson Agonistes - as well as his great early poems Lycidas, and Comus, in the context of biblical and classical literary traditions as well as the religious and political crises of his time. Milton's controversial prose writings on education, kingship, marriage, and freedom of the press will also be considered. |#|LIT 097  CM|^|T.S. Eliot and His Circle|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|This course offers an examination of T.S. Eliot, one of the preeminent poets of the twentieth century. We will consider the entirety of Eliots small output of poems and plays and many of his seminal critical essays, studying his relation to traditions of British, European, and classical poetry and his engagement with philosophical, moral, metaphysical, and religious questions. We will pay special attention to issues of modernism, poetic form, and intertextuality, to the idea of a poetic canon, and to the links between poetry and the other arts (music, painting, sculpture). We will also situate Eliots work in the context of the broader sociocultural crisis of modernity in the first half of the twentieth century, as well as in its contemporary literary context, spending time on other poets whom Eliot admired and was influenced by, such as Pound and Yeats, but also on poets who rebelled against his influence, such as William Carlos Williams.
|#|LIT 099  CM|^|Special Topics in Literature|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|Offered occasionally. The topic for Spring 2023 is " California Poetry":

We will survey poetry written in the 20th and 21st centuries by Californians with a sense of local subject matter.  To get started weâll read Joan Didionâs recent Where I Was From (2003).  This will provide a sense of California as subject matter.  Didion, a distinguished journalist, essayist, shows what a writer with a strong sense of a contemporary reading audience makes of her home state.  From there we will read small samples of a large number of poets and use general themes, some expressed by Didion, to bring these themes into relation to one another: landscape, labor, fortunes, indigenous peoples, religion.  |#|LIT 099  CM|^|Special Topics in Literature|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|Offered occasionally.

No other film genre has so extensively perpetuatedâor resistedâracist stereotypes as the Hollywood Western. This is especially true of the Native American image on screen, but applies as well to the portrayal of people of African, Mexican, and Chinese heritageâall of whom played an important role in the historical west, and an equally important though often distorted role in the cinematic west. In this course, we will explore multiple aspects of racial representation in the Western film from 1950 to the present.  In addition, the course will introduce students to the contributions made to the Western genre by performers and filmmakers from various racial and ethnic backgrounds. Readings in history, film studies, and literature will supplement our examination of individual films.|#|LIT 099B CM|^|Special Topics in Literature|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|The topic for spring 2023 is "Southern Black Writers": 


Traditionally, the study of African American literature has closely followed the pattern of the Great Migration, focusing on the narratives of black people who moved north and west in pursuit of economic opportunity. This course will explore the lives of those who stayed behind. Beginning with the writings of Zora Neale Hurston and ending with the fiction and poetry or award-winning fiction writers and poets like Jesmyn Ward and Jericho Brown, students will read and think critically about black writers who lived in and wrote about the American South.|#|LIT 099C CM|^|Special Topics in Literature|^|MLIT|^||^|CM|^|The topic for spring 2023 is "Religion and Literature".

The course will include a variety of poems and works of fiction which have particular religious themes.  It will be divided into four sections: scriptures, mystical works, analogical and visionary works, and spiritual biography.  It will include works from four religious traditions: Judaism. Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism.  |#|LIT 100  CM|^|Literary Theory Since Plato|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|What is a good book? How do we decide whether a work of literature is worth reading? What is the basis of literary judgment? How do we bring history, religion, and myth to bear on our understanding of literary texts? How does imaginative literature differ from other forms of discourse? These are among the fundamental questions explored in this course through the eyes of major literary thinkers. The course examines literary criticism as a discipline with unique traditions of inquiry beginning with classical debates about form and reality and the tensions between the moral and aesthetic dimensions of literature as they have been engaged by such writers as Plato and Aristotle, Sidney, Johnson, Wordsworth and Coleridge, Arnold and Pater, Woolf, and Eliot. |#|LIT 104  HM|^|Intro Middle English Literature|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|A course for students interested in developing a basic ability to translate and pronounce Middle English. Works studied will include: the first fragment of Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales; Sir Orfeo; Sir Gawain and the Green Knight; and selections from Malory's Le Morte D' Arthur.

HSA Writing Intensive: No|#|LIT 106  CM|^|Gay Poets, Poems, Poetry|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|This class is a survey of 20th century American gay poets, with a look back at Whitman, Cavafy, Lorca, Pasolini, and Sappho. There will be close readings of poems by W. H. Auden, H.D. Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes, Hart Crane, James Baldwin, Frank OâHara, Robert Hayden, Elizabeth Bishop, James Merrill, Robert Duncan, Allen Ginsberg, Adrienne Rich, Audre Lorde, Thom Gunn, May Swenson, James Schuyler, Mary Oliver, Kay Ryan, Frank Bidart and others. The class will consider questions such as: Do social identities change the words we write? Do same-sex affinities affect poetic composition. Are gay poets alike, with a unique gay perspective, language, and style? The answer, we may find, is a resounding NO, but the study of these American poets (with consideration of earlier gay poetry) will illuminate a remarkable river of literature about the body, sexuality, desire, and same-sex love.
|#|LIT 117A HM|^|Dickens, Hardy, & Victorian Age|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|An intensive study of the work and literary development of Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy. Readings drawn from the authors' works and related critical, biographical, and historical texts. Class travels to England over Winter break; travel expenses are the responsibility of the student. Prerequisite: Instructor permission required.  

HSA Writing Intensive: No|#|LIT 118  CM|^|The Romantic Revolution|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|A study of the revolution in human consciousness known as Romanticism. The course concentrates on the British Romantics, but also studies Romanticism as an international phenomenon. Writers studied include Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Rousseau, Goethe, Schiller, Emerson, Thoreau, Lermontov.|#|LIT 119  CM|^|19th Century Russian Novel|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|This course examines the explosive growth of the Russian novel. Students will read major works by Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy and will become familiar with such themes as Slavophilism, realism, revolution versus tradition, and national identity. |#|LIT 125  CM|^|20th C. English & Irish Poetry|^|MLIT|^||^|CM|^|This course will introduce English and Irish poetry of the 20th century, with special attention to the central figures of Hardy, Yeats, and Auden, but also including, among others, Houseman, Hopkins, the poets of World War One, Dylan Thomas, Larkin, Hughes, and Heaney.|#|LIT 130  CM|^|Introduction to Film|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|From its inception, cinema has often been conceptualized as having a "language" of its own. This course examines that metaphor from aesthetic, cultural, social, and historical perspectives. We will begin with a close analysis of a contemporary popular film, in an effort to "defamiliarize" typical conventions of cinematic expression, and then proceed through a study of multiple movements and genres in the history of film, from German Expressionism to the French New Wave, from Hollywood to documentary to avant-grade and independent filmmaking. Overall, the course is intended to provide students with a broad introduction to film analysis and to the field of Film Studies. |#|LIT 132  CM|^|Film History II (1965-Present)|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|This course surveys the history of cinema as art and mass medium, from 1965 to the present. Topics such as the rise of independent filmmaking in America, the conglomeration of the studios, and European resistance to Hollywood's domination on the world market are considered in social, cultural, and aesthetic terms. |#|LIT 134C CM|^|Special Studies in Film|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|A seminar designed to explore the aesthetic achievement and social impact of film as an art form. Subjects for study include such topics as specific film genres, the work of individual film-makers, and recurring themes in film. Each year the seminar concentrates on a different area - for example, "Film and Politics," "The Director as Author," or "Violence and the Hero in American Films." Repeatable for differing topics.

The topic for spring 2023 is "Spy Films".

This course focuses on spy-thrillers.  The films are entertainments, but they deal directly with political subjects; they imagine ways of being a patriot, an effective agent, a reliable civil servant, and of pursuing the interests of a state beyond lawful, acknowledged procedures.  We will emphasize interpretations that engage these concerns, and look to some essays by political philosophers to guide our analyses.   
|#|LIT 138  CM|^|Film and Mass Culture|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|This course will examine film as art and as medium in the context of the rise of 20th-century "mass culture." We will take up such topics as the role of film in producing the ideas of "mass culture"; the cinematic representation of the "masses;" film as an instrument of the standardization of culture and as a mode of resistance to it; film and modernism; film and postmodernism; representations of fascism in cinema; and "subculture" considered as an effect of mass culture.|#|LIT 139  CM|^|Film Theory|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|This course investigates the major film theories from the beginnings of cinema to the present.  We begin with a study of classical film theory (1900-1960) that attempts to define the essence of the form, its relation to reality, and its status as mass medium and/or art.  We then move on to more recent work that examines film from ideological, sociological, or psychological perspectives, or considers the changing nature of cinema in the digital age.
|#|LIT 141  HM|^|Monsters in Literature|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|Our culture is fascinated by things that are weird, strange, horrifying, and grotesque. In other words, were fascinated by monsters, those others that stand at the margins of human, civilized society, threatening us by their very existence. Are monsters only very scary things, or do they have a social and cultural function? In this course we will take up this and other questions as we investigate the nature of the monstrous. Moreover, we will explore the libidinal charge that the recognition of the monstrous or unnatural being evokes. Thus, we will examine both the physical and psychological permutations of monstrosity. In this course, we will consider monsters in their non-human, alien, and technological forms as well as some truly terrifying human monsters.

HSA Writing Intensive: Yes.|#|LIT 155  HM|^|Post-Apartheid Narratives|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|This seminar maps the literary terrain of contemporary South Africa. Through an examination of prose, poetry, and visual material, this course offers some of the responses writers have given to the end of Apartheid, to major social events such as the hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and to the idea of a "new" South Africa.

HSA Writing Intensive: Yes|#|LIT 158  HM|^|Zora Neale Hurston|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|This seminar is designed to introduce students to Zora Neale Hurston as an ethnographer and fiction writer. Hurston was the first African American woman to graduate from Barnard College. Born in the South, highly educated in the North, a luminary amongst the talents of the Harlem Renaissance, and buried in an unmarked grave in her native Florida, Hurstons writing and life offer a unique view onto notions of race, gender, art, and class in the aftermath of Reconstruction that reverberate to this day.

HSA Writing Intensive: Yes|#|LIT 162  AF|^|African Literature|^|MMOD|^||^|CM|^|Reading and analysis of novels, poetry, and essays representing the most important trends in modern African literature.

|#|LIT 163  AF|^|North African Literature/Culture|^|MMOD|^|05.0201|^|CM|^|This course is an introduction to North African Studies which offers an overview of North African literature and culture, through a selection of the works of some of the most important North African authors from diverse ethnic backgrounds (Arab, Berber, French and Jewish). In addition, we will consider a selection of films, photographs, and other visual culture which will provide further insights into the complex social political and religious fabric of each country and the region as a whole. And, of course, we will consider music, which, along with poetry, is a cultural practice and form which is oral and an essential aspect of the everyday life in North Africa.

|#|LIT 177  CM|^|The Art of Oratory|^|MLIT|^||^|CM|^|Great speeches have changed history. This course will explore the art of oratory from ancient Greece to modern America. Examination of speeches of Demosthenes, Pericles, Cicero, Burke, Webster, Lincoln, Churchill, Martin Luther King and others will be combined with study of theories of oratory and rhetoric from Aristotle to Wayne Booth. Major speeches from classical and modern drama and epic including Shakespeare, Milton and Melville will also be studied along with films and recordings of 20th-century political oratory. Speech writing and performance will form a practical component of this course.|#|LIT 179AGHM|^|Radio Shakespeare|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|In this course we will explore Shakespeare's plays through literary- and performance-based techniques. There will be a special focus on close reading and on vocal techniques. The semester will culminate in a radio performance, created by the whole class.|#|LIT 181  CM|^|Advanced Creative Writing|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|This is a class for the student who is serious about writing fiction and non-fiction and poetry. There will be frequent short assignments for workshop discussion and a longer final one. For permission to enroll, email the instructor with a writing sample. 
|#|LIT 183  CM|^|Advanced Fiction Writing|^|MLIT|^||^|CM|^|This advanced fiction workshop is intended for people who have taken at least one semester of Fiction Writing (Lit. 38).  Each student will submit two stories or novel excerpts for workshop, where they will be carefully critiqued by the class.  We'll also read short fiction by well-known contemporary writers, with an eye toward what makes these stories original, entertaining, and complex.  In class, we'll look beyond basic elements of craft and address issues of concern for the experienced writer.  How do we avoid cliche?  Create narrative drive?  Take risks with form, language, and subject matter? Written exercises will focus on these issues while challenging students to push their writing in unexpected directions. May be repeated once for credit. May count toward the CMC literature major only once. Prerequisite: LIT 038 CM.  |#|LIT 185  CM|^|Poetry Writing II|^|MLIT|^||^|CM|^|This is an intermediate and advanced undergraduate poetry writing workshop for those who wish to improve their craft as poets while broadening their knowledge of poetry. Much of the term will be devoted to weekly exercises as preparation for later "free-assignments." Poems by students will be discussed in a "workshop" format with attention to the process of revision. Class time will also be spent on assigned readings and issues of craft. Students will be asked to regularly memorize and recite poems. A final portfolio of six thoroughly revised poems will be required for completion of the course.

To request permission to enroll, submit to hcole@cmc.edu three poems with a cover letter (including your name, email address, a list of literature and creative writing courses taken to date, favorite poets, other reasons you wish to enroll in this poetry workshop).|#|LIT 195  CM|^|Studies in Literature: Frost|^|MLIT|^|23.0101|^|CM|^|An examination of the poetry and prose of Robert Frost, one of the preeminent American poets. Consideration will be given to Frosts work in relation to traditions of pastoral poetry and classical authors, his innovations in blank verse and English metrics, his dialogue with science and pragmatism, and his thinking about the nature of metaphor and poetic drama. Careful attention will be given to Frosts ambivalent relationship to literary modernism, American predecessors, especially Emerson, Thoreau, and Dickinson, his reaction to the New Deal and the Cold War, and the complex history of Frost
biography. Offered every other year.
|#|MATH001  PO|^|Math, Phil & the Real World|^|PMAT|^||^|PO|^|Throughout history, mathematics has changed the way people look at the world. This course will include examples such as: Euclidean geometry (which suggested to philosophers that certainty was achievable by human thought), discussions of the infinite (which confounded the believer and the agnostic alike) and probability and statistics (which gave scientists a way of dealing with events that did not seem to follow any laws but those of chance). Readings and problems will be taken from several types of sources, including historical, mathematical and philosophical texts. Offered jointly by Pitzer and Pomona colleges. Prerequisites: High-school Algebra and Geometry.|#|MATH010W PZ|^|Form & Formal, Maths & Woodwork|^|ZMAT|^||^|PZ|^|Form and Formal, Mathematics and Woodworking

Worldbuilding is the practice of creating a fully developed fictionalized environment in which the political, historical, cultural, environmental, philosophical (and more) are fully conceptualized and explored. Throughout the semester, students will engage with different forms of concepting and world-design such as creative writing, storyboarding, digital painting and photobashing in order to understand and visualize their respective worlds. This will ultimately culminate in the creation of a media artwork that portrays a narrative within this created universe. In addition to this, we will engage with a variety of films, artworks, games and more to learn about the process of world creation.

Talking about games may conjure memories of Sonic and Mario, but gaming long precedes the digital forms we know today. Games are as old as any human art form and exist across every culture; playful behavior even precedes human language. In this course we will explore this question through a formal approach, focusing on game design as a creative and cultural practice with deep history and common principles that can be studied, practiced and effectively enacted. In this setting, game design does not require mastery of code nor a life-long obsession with games. Rather, like other aesthetic and experiential forms, game design has fundamentals that may apply across media, platforms and contexts.

This class will ground its inquiry in the fundamental question: what do we make of the encounter between the one and an(other)? To answer this, we will examine a challenging set of philosophical texts and a range of media that revolve around the intersubjective relation (or non-relation) of two central characters or figures. Objects of study will include Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise and Abbas Kiarostami's Certified Copy, Phoebe Waller-Bridge's television series Fleabag, Season 1 of Sarah Koenig's podcast Serial and Fumito Ueda's classic minimalist video game Ico.

creative writing and web design projects that integrate visual art, animation, narrative and rule-based play.|#|MS  132  SC|^|Theories of Interaction|^|SART|^|50.0699|^|SC|^|This course explores cultural techniques and technologies of interaction, including but not limited to games, motion capture, and virtual reality.  This semester, we will use the topic of games to unpack notions of interaction within a productive set of limits.  Games are interactive media.  And more and more, they are everywhere.  While Eric Zimmerman calls our present moment the "ludic century," Alex Galloway describes it as "an era of ludic capitalism."  In this moment, making and playing games ranges across the personal, political, professional, prescribed, and performative.  Students will explore central questions in media theory and game studies while developing projects about formal, material, technical, social, and theoretical understandings of interaction.

In particular, it is interested in exploring the many relationships between media and the environment, including not only the representations of the natural world in media such as film, photography, and digital media but also the material entanglements of media technologies with surrounding built and natural environments. |#|MS  140  PO|^|Screening Violence|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|The focus of this course is on representations of violence on screens and its widespread consumption. Through a range of theoretical texts and in conjunction with detailed analysis of select films and media, this course examines and debates the various, competing accounts of depicting, disseminating, and consuming images of violence. How did the omnipresence of scenes of violence on screens become a transnational phenomenon? Why does it have the power to move, excite or titillate us? What is our responsibility to images of violence, if any? These are some of the questions we will address as we chart the history of screening violence from early film and media to the present. Letter grade only. |#|MS  141  PO|^|Cinema, Sensation, and the Body|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|To what extent does watching a movie imitate the body's own sensorial encounters with the world? How do filmmakers use color, sound, lighting, movement, editing and space to create embodied experience? This course is an introduction to these and related questions by examining both cinema's bodily representations and the relationship between the viewer's body and the events on the screen. Our approach is organized around a diverse cross-section of film screenings that include art cinema, experimental cinema, Hollywood melodrama, global cinema, and body horror. Turning attention to what is at stake when we consider what it means to feel cinema permits a wide range of critical approaches to screen media including continental philosophy, media theory, genre theory, experimental cinema, and feminist thought. Throughout the semester, we will become better acquainted with the sensuous facets of cinema along with the social, political, and aesthetic possibilities cinema affords when understood as both appealing to a sensuous body and being a sensuous body in its own right. Prerequisites: MS  049  PO, or MS  050  PO, or MS  051  PO or equivalent. Letter grade only.|#|MS  142  PO|^|Queer Visions, Queer Theory|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|This seminar explores the intersection of cinema and media aesthetics, sexuality, and queer theory. We will consider a range of creative works from the era of silent cinema through to contemporary online media, asking how sexuality functions within them as a disturbing force shaping what can be seen and what cannot be articulated, and how they draw on and interrogate ideas of desire, the couple, the family, community, reproduction, and sociality itself. To this analysis we will bring resources from critical theory, especially feminist, queer, and trans theory. Weekly film screening required.|#|MS  144  PO|^|Masculinities|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|This course explores how in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, masculinity has served as a constant (and constantly shifting) object of cultural fantasy, inextricable from the changing ways we understand and imagine gender, sex, class, race, and nation. Precisely because, in the US and Europe, white masculinity has named a position (or fantasy) of cultural dominance; one often confused with the ostensibly "universal." We will focus especially on the minoritarian and situated perspectives on masculinity opened up by nonwhite, trans, queer, and/or feminist writers, theorists, and film-makers.|#|MS  146  PO|^|Temp. of the Moving Image|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|This course will concentrate on time as a category of analysis. Cinema possesses distinct affinities with the rationalization of labor and standardization of time that took place at the end of the nineteenth century, and yet it also provides a way of negotiating and resisting these processes, as it imagines alternative relations to standardized time. The course begins from the proposition that cinema provided a way for the twentieth century to re-think its changed relation to time after industrial modernity. Topics will include amnesia, boredom, duration, distraction, memory, the supposed death of cinema, real time, and simultaneity. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: MS  049  PO, MS  050  PO, or MS  051  PO.|#|MS  147H PO|^|Reality, Realism and the Real|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|In the humanities, Realism has been criticized for impressing upon audiences the illusion that they are watching real life events unfold spontaneously before their eyes - an illusion that takes on a politically conservative role as a vehicle for the circulation of dominant ideological meanings. In the sciences, by contrast, Realism has attracted far more favorable reviews: for example, Einstein writes that "If one renounces this assumption [of Realism]then I do not see what physics is supposed to describe." In this course we will examine the interplay between these two attitudes towards Realism. In particular we will suggest that it is possible to recuperate a politically progressive role for Realism as an aesthetic-representational form. Letter grade only.

It invokes the drone -- understood not just as a weaponized device but as forming part of a distributed, mobile, interactive, information network -- to explore emerging logics of interactivity, data processing and automation. The course will rely upon critical theory to examine the development of asymmetrical power and remote control associated with drones and will situate the drone within the cultural imaginary, drawing upon the historical relationship between military and media technology. The goal will be to use the figure of the drone to illuminate more general logics of cybernetic control -- their fantasies and actualities and the ways in which these relate to historical figures of automata, telepresence and action-at-a-distance. Additionally, the class will explore and critique theoretical developments that anticipate the forms of knowing, sensing and experiencing associated with the figure of the drone. Letter grade only.|#|MS  148D PO|^|Powers of Pleasure|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|This course interrogates John Fiske's contention that "pleasure may be the bait on the hook of hegemony, but it is always more than this; it always involves an element that escapes the system of power." With this claim in mind, we will: 1) evaluate key arguments in the field regarding pleasure's complicity with dominant ideological frameworks--particularly with regard to normative views of gender, race, class and sexuality; 2) consider ways in which the critique of pleasure itself may collude with patriarchal, racist, clasist and heteronormative systems of thought; and 3) explore the possibilities for pleasure to undermine established systems of power.

The method of distributing installments of a larger narrative over time has seen increasing prominence in a variety of media forms, ever since the birth of mass media and the serial novel in the mid-19th century. From the early film serials of The Perils of Pauline and Flash Gordon to Star Wars and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, from the popular radio serials of The Shadow and The Lone Ranger to true crime podcasts Serial and My Favorite Murder, from the development of the traditional network television series to the 'binge model' of Netflix, serial narrative has enabled complex longform storytelling and engaged and enraged audiences. But to study seriality is not just to observe an industry strategy for releasing narrative. Nor is it sufficient to simply acknowledge how seriality ensnares author, text, and audience. The study of seriality involves excavating and articulating a comprehensive theory. Looking to psychoanalysis, existentialism, radical feminism, and Black Marxism, with supplemental examination of narrative, audience, and authorship studies, this course will aim to understand seriality as a textual, social, psychical, and political form.

This class will study photographic technology from prehistoric times to 1976. Students will build photographic devices, reproduce chemistry, and make images following techniques ranging from archaeological optics, lensed cameras, all the way to the first digital sensor cameras.  Activities include building camera obscuras, pinhole cameras, lensed cameras, and electronic light sensors. Students will use these devices to create projections, photograms, cyanotypes, and electronic images. We will pay special attention to the work required to create durable images and consider a range of ideas about the legibility and meaning of photography.|#|MS  160  SC|^|Computational Photography II|^|SART|^|50.0699|^|SC|^|Computers can correct flaws in traditional photography, and photographers are happy to use some or all of these tools to improve their images. Focus, aperture, and shutter may be automated alone or in concert. These fixes are just the beginning of the ways that computation will change photography. Soon cameras will make images without optics, manipulate time to sharpen the image, even see around corners to recover faces. We will study the impacts that computational photography will make on the arts, consider the consequences of new propaganda, and propose tactics to deal with these disruptions.  Part 2 builds on our study of cameras and representation and moves into computer vision, image processing, digital cameras, image segmentation, high-dynamic-range imaging, texture analysis and synthesis, object detection, and projector-camera systems. Course work includes implementing relevant algorithms and completing a final project.

We will analyze the production and consumption of black representations in mainstream American media and explore the ways these processes influence basic assumptions about social roles, expectations, and norms that tend to inhere to concepts of 'blackness' and black popular culture. Students will be encouraged to develop a critical and political consciousness around historical formations of black identity, their own participation in embracing and/or resisting black representations, and the impact of black popular culture on their lived experiences. The course will be structured as a seminar and will emphasize collaborative thinking and discussion. Each class will feature a media component, a brief lecture putting the assigned media and readings into context, followed by collective discussion and contribution. Letter grade only.|#|MS  171  PO|^|A.I.: Humans and Machines|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|The rapid development of A.I. technologies, in which machines take on functions previously associated with human cognition, raises the question of what, if anything, is unique to human experience: a capacity for desire? humor? abstract thinking? aesthetic judgment? In this class we will examine how the boundary between the human and the machine appears as an object of investigation in contemporary literature and film, as well as in media theory and critical theory. These texts bear on topics that include surveillance and facial recognition; techno-utopianism and dystopianism; the algorithmic reproduction of bias; and the technological sublime. Students will work on creative research projects that may take a range of forms.|#|MS  173  HM|^|Exile in Cinema|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|A thematic and formal study of the range of cinematic responses to the experience of exile. Exile is an event, but how does it come about and what are its ramifications? Exile happens to individuals but also to collectivities. How does it effect a change between the self and society, homeland and site of displacement, mother tongue and acquired language? This course examines how filmmakers take on an often painful historical process through creativity. Among the authors to read are Aime Cesaire, Edward Said, George Lamming, V. S. Naipaul, Med Hondo, and Hamid Naficy; films to be viewed focus on Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

HSA Writing Intensive: No|#|MS  174  PO|^|Film Noir|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|This course offers a detailed exploration of film noir from its emergence in the classical Hollywood tradition of the 1940s to the present.  We will study film noir's roots in German Expressionism, Depression-Era gangster movies, and film adaptations of hard-boiled detective fiction. We will also consider the unique cultural factors in post-World War II America that gave rise to film noir and its enduring legacy in the French New Wave, its 1970s revival in American grindhouse cinema, and the resurgence of "neo-noir" in contemporary American cinema and abroad.|#|MS  175  PO|^|"Horror" and The American Horror|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|Of all the film genres that partition and divide the products of American cinema, the horror genre has proven to be the most durable and the most easily adaptable to the shifting historical circumstances and socio-political anxieties to which it runs parallel. This course examines some of the key factors that have contributed to the horror genres capacity to maintain its continued viability in popular culture across a wide range of media including graphic novels, video art, and interactive gaming. Beginning with the modern period of the American horror film and then expanding beyond its physical and ideological borders, this course is designed to encourage students to challenge the ideas that have become associated with the term "horror," and to consider whether some other term or terms may be better suited to describe the types of feelings horror films and its related forms of media actually inspire. We will consider some of the following questions: What is horror? Do horror genre films truly inspire horror or are we, as participants, moved by some other affect or response? Is it possible to locate cinematic representations of horror and its experience outside of the horror genre? Prerequisites: MS  049  PO, or MS  050  PO, or MS  051  PO or equivalent. Letter grade only.|#|MS  180  PO|^|The War Film|^|PMST|^||^|PO|^|This course surveys the history of the war film. Our focus will center mainly upon Hollywood cinema's depiction of warfare, but the course also expands beyond American borders to explore the genre in a global context. While the Hollywood war film can often serve as a platform for glorifying armed conflict and celebrating the heroism of the combatant, it has also historically been a site of political and ideological critique, and has served as a barometer of the social mood and public perception of warfare. Throughout the semester we will examine representations of war in cinema across the 20th century and into the 21st century, tracking its impact and its aftermath at the level of the political and social, but also at the level of the subjective and the psychological. We will develop the critical and theoretical frameworks necessary to grapple with aesthetics of violence, reading work from Prince, Massumi, Baurillard, Virilio, Foucault, and Scarry, among others. Topics will include, torture, preemption, genocide, trauma, deterrence, revenge, reintegration and forgiveness. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: MS  050  PO or equivalent.|#|MS  180  SC|^|Jr Sem in Media Studies Prod|^|CJT|^|50.0699|^|SC|^|The Junior Seminar in Media Studies Production is a studio/seminar course that prepares majors for their senior thesis project and exhibition.

More than presenting a series of individual case studies, we seek and forge pathways of understanding across time period and national divide, to articulate ways in which queerness?here broadly defined as the experience of 'otherness' in gender or sexual identity relative to societal expectations?inevitably enlivens and drives forward the very cultures and characters that ostensibly serve to suppress it. In mapping European and American music's queer underground, we delve into provocative topics like operatic castration practices, eroticism in convent music, synthesizers and transgender embodiment, David Bowie's and Prince's gender-fluid personae, LGBTQIA+ roots of Disco and House (EDM), and more.

Chronic daily pain affects over 50 million Americans at an estimated cost of over $600 billion annually, and it affects one in five people globally, including children. Despite intense research efforts, the basic biological mechanisms behind chronic pain - and how to effectively treat it - remain mysterious. The course will focus on the neurobiological basis of chronic pain, ranging from genetic risks to the ion channels that convey painful signals to the brain networks that underlie our experience of pain. However, chronic pain is best viewed through the lens of a biopsychosocial model, considering the biological, psychological and sociological factors that shape each individual's experience of chronic pain. In this seminar, we will examine these factors through peer-reviewed primary research papers, articles in the popular press, and guest appearances by pain researchers.|#|NEUR189TLPO|^|Lab, Neuroendocrinology|^|PNEU|^||^|PO|^||#|NEUR189TLPO|^|Lab, Neuroendocrinology|^|PNEU|^||^|PO|^||#|NEUR190  PO|^|Senior Seminar: Advanced Topics|^|PNEU|^||^|PO|^|Senior Seminar.

Topics vary by semester but might include: What justifies scientific reasoning? How do we measure the strength of evidence and update our theories accordingly? Can observations be truly objective? To what extent is scientific inquiry affected by social and cultural values? How does the explosion of technology both facilitate and hinder the scientific method? How can we guide technological developments to be more just and fair?
|#|PHIL035  PO|^|Well-being and Autonomy|^|PPHI|^||^|PO|^|This course focuses on two important ethical values, well-being and autonomy and what to do when the pursuit of one conflicts with the other. What makes someones life go better or worse? What if someones life can be made to go better or at least prevented from going worse but only at the cost of undermining that persons autonomy, that is, by interfering with how the person has chosen to live her or his life? What if the greater good of a community requires limitations on personal freedoms or the infringement of the right not to be harmed? Possible contexts of conflict include sports, medicine, national security and war.

We will explore this and other Socratic paradoxes - for example his claims that he did not know anything but was wiser than anyone he had ever met; that knowledge and virtue are the same thing; that no one knowingly or willingly does wrong; that it is better to be the victim of injustice than to be unjust; that a worse person cannot harm a better one. We will also investigate his claim to be the first genuine philosopher, his importance in the subsequent history of philosophy and his iconic place in human culture.|#|PHIL052  PZ|^|Philosophy of Religion|^|ZPHI|^||^|PZ|^|The philosophy of religion is concerned with
philosophical reflection on a broad range of questions concerning religious belief.
The nature of religious belief is quite varied across cultures. In Western theism
belief in God and a belief in personal immortality are two central religious beliefs. So
philosophy of religion in the West is largely concerned with explicating and clarifying
the concept of God and life after death, as well as considering the alleged reasons
for supposing God exists or that there is life after death. However, in other traditions
belief in reincarnation and karma are central beliefs and so questions regarding the
nature, meaning and justification of the concepts of reincarnation and karma are
important for an Eastern philosophy of religion. In this course, we will examine
similar philosophical questions from Western and Eastern religious traditions as well
as African, Native American and a variety of other world religions.|#|PHIL054  PO|^|Existentialism|^|PPHI|^||^|PO|^|How does one find meaning in a seemingly meaningless world?

This survey course covers a variety of philosophies of film, with special emphasis on continental European traditions including phenomenology, critical theory, Marxism, feminist and queer theory, and poststructuralism. The course also puts the philosophy of film in dialogue with the history of aesthetics, questioning whether film fits into traditional theories of art and whether film has the power to improve and/or corrupt societies. Periodic film viewings will also be required.|#|PHIL074  PZ|^|Power and Politics in Art|^|ZPHI|^||^|PZ|^|Art is often said to have the power to transcend the mundane, and yet the production, significance, and reception of art are thoroughly worldly matters. This has always been the case, but over the past century theorists have interrogated the relationship between art, power, and politics with increasing urgency. In our contemporary world saturated with images, how do they instantiate or challenge relationships of power? If the artist is but a product of social forces, how should we then conceive of the artwork? How is it possible to analyze racialized and gendered power dynamics aesthetically? Movements covered will include post-structuralism, French feminism, the Frankfurt School, and Black aesthetics.|#|PHIL080  PO|^|Philosophy of Mind|^|PPHI|^||^|PO|^|Philosophy of Mind.

As a historical evolution of Greek Philosophy, Islamic philosophy synthesizes both the Aristotelian and the Post-Plotinian traditions in an independent way. From the ninth century to the present day, a set of philosophical topics has been systematically discussed and developed by philosophers in the Islamic world. We will discuss topics including the divine attribute and essence, the origin and the nature of the universe, the relation between philosophy and religion, the existence and faculties of the soul, the idea of the philosopher king, Skepticism, what is Islam, the concept of humanity in Islam, mysticism, the problem of good and evil, the end of postcolonialism, women and the Quran. Through selective readings of philosophical texts, we will introduce the main figures, including al-Farabi, Avicenna, al-Ghazali, Averreos, al-Razi, Ibn Tufayl, Arkoun, Shariati, Nasr Abu Zayd, Amina Wadud, and Abd al-Raziq, Hamid Dabashi. |#|PHIL090  SC|^|Introduction to Philosophy|^|SPHI|^|38.0101|^|SC|^|Introduction to the basic questions and investigations of modern Western philosophy, including: the nature of knowledge, truth, and reality; the existence of god; the possibility of free will; the nature of morality; the requirements of morality; the relative merit of various political theories; and the meaning of life.|#|PHIL090  SC|^|Introduction to Philosophy|^|SPHI|^|38.0101|^|SC|^|Introduction to the basic questions and investigations of modern Western philosophy, including: the nature of knowledge, truth, and reality; the existence of god; the possibility of free will; the nature of morality; the requirements of morality; the relative merit of various political theories; and the meaning of life.|#|PHIL090  SC|^|Introduction to Philosophy|^|SPHI|^|38.0101|^|SC|^|Introduction to the basic questions and investigations of modern Western philosophy, including: the nature of knowledge, truth, and reality; the existence of god; the possibility of free will; the nature of morality; the requirements of morality; the relative merit of various political theories; and the meaning of life.|#|PHIL095  CM|^|Fundamentals of Logic|^|MPHI|^|38.0101|^|CM|^|An introduction to formal techniques for evaluating arguments.

The focus of the course is methodological, its goal to teach students skills which will enable them to develop their own interpretation and critiques of classical philosophical texts. We will focus on the works of Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics and the Skeptics.  Some of the questions we will address will be what philosophy is, what one should aim at in life, what kinds of things exist, and what can be known. Offered every year.
|#|PHIL100E CM|^|Special Topics: Hist of Philos|^|MPHI|^||^|CM|^|This course covers special topics in the history of philosophy. These will include at least: Ancient Greek philosophy, Early Modern European philosophy, and Continental Philosophy. The course content changes each time the course is offered.

The metaphysics and epistemology of the Early Modern period - especially in Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley and Hume - is sometimes taught in a way suggesting that this period in Europe is central and the norm, so that all else would be merely peripheral. Our class will study that period while also de-centering it. We will frame our philosophical questions initially from a look at Buddhist and Islamic metaphysics. We will then be able find the philosophical ideas and arguments all around more interesting after dislodging the assumption that there is one center and norm for all philosophy.

How do I sustain my moral commitments in situations of temptation and duress?  The Greek and Roman philosophers of the Hellenistic period (4th century BC to 2nd century AD) pursued these questions in one of the most vigorous and probing debates in the history of Western philosophy.  The Stoics identified happiness with virtue, the Epicureans with pleasure, and the Skeptics with the acceptance of one's intellectual limitations.  This course will focus on a close study of these three schools of philosophy.  We will study the writings of figures ranging from Epictetus, a freed slave, to Marcus Aurelius, Roman emperor.

A focus of the course will be ways in which biology has been used as a means to understand humans, in terms of their evolutionary history and more recently, in terms of genetics. We will examine some of the distinctive concepts and theoretical resources of the life sciences, like the theory of natural selection, the concept of species, reductionistic explanatory strategies and methodological worries about adaptationism. The course will examine how these conceptual and methodological issues are involved in many of the aspects of the life science that concern categories of difference in human societies, like race and gender.

In what ways are we ethically accountable to non-human animals? How can our ideas about politics do justice to our relationships with the more-than-human world? How, in turn, do our conceptions of ethics and politics change when we take animals seriously? Many thinkers recognize that these questions, long kept in the margins of canonical philosophy, are increasingly central and urgent. This course introduces students to some of the ways these questions have been pursued.   Throughout the course, we will remain attuned to real-world cases while we parse the limits of our philosophical and political imagination regarding what a good relationship to the non-human world might be.|#|PHIL109IOCM|^|Africana Philosophy|^|MPHI|^||^|CM|^|Philosophical thought and the philosophical cannon cannot be restricted to the âgreat thinkersâ of western history. This course will be a general introduction to Africana Philosophy. We will unveil not only that philosophy is more than the western world and has points of origin in other places, such as Africa, but we will also discover how Africana philosophy serves as a challenge to the integrity of integral concepts and themes in modern western philosophy; for example, the subject, freedom, the human, and even ontology. We will achieve these insights through a survey of thinkers, writers, and people who address themes such as traditional Africana thought, black existentialism, black feminism, post colonialism, whiteness, double consciousness, and Afro-pessimism.

Students should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing (available through Student Healthcare Services for $10), and the need to submit personal information for background checks. Students will be asked to pay a $15 course fee to cover the cost of a required safety whistle and a class t-shirt, to be donned by all students for all class sessions. |#|PHIL111  HM|^|Empirical/ExperimentalPhilosophy|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|To what extent is philosophy grounded on or informed by empirical observation and experimentation? To what extent ought it be so? To explore these questions, this course will make stops at important moments in the history of philosophysuch as Descartes' armchair philosophizing and Carol Gilligan's interviewing women about moralityon its way to the present movement called "experimental philosophy," wherein philosophers conduct experiments similar to those in cognitive and social science in order to address philosophical questions. Students will learn how philosophers think about intuitions and the roles they play in grounding and challenging theories in ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, etc. In addition, students will explore important intersections between philosophy and science, such as the emergence of neurophilosophy and moral psychology in the 20th century. The armchair isn't going anywhere, but neither is the question of which methods of inquiry, namely those empirically informed, are part of the philosopher's toolkit in addressing diverse questions about mind, knowledge, and morality.|#|PHIL112  SC|^|History of Philosophy: Ancient|^|SPHI|^|38.0101|^|SC|^|The following movements and figures in ancient philosophy are considered: the Pre-Socratics, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Skepticism.

|#|PHIL119  SC|^|History of Existentialism|^|SPHI|^|38.0101|^|SC|^|In this course, we will read and analyze the major works of important figures in the existentialist and phenomenological movements, focusing on the questions of human freedom, subjectivitiy, and meaning. Readings may include works by Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Sartre, de Beauvoir, Heidegger, Husserl, and many other thinkers of this time period to gain an understanding of existentialist thought. 
|#|PHIL120  PO|^|Metaphysics|^|PPHI|^||^|PO|^|This course is a study of basic issues concerning existence: What is there? What is it like? Possible topics include the relation of the mind and body, causation and indeterminacy and their implications for freedom, the nature of time, persistence through time, particulars and universals, necessity and possibility, and the nature of truth. Course is equivalent to PHIL126  CM.|#|PHIL121  HM|^|Ethical Theory|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|A survey of contemporary philosophical thinking about morality, emphasizing how metaethical inquiry into the nature of "goodness," "virtue" and "moral obligation" can inform normative inquiry into what is good and how to live. Attention is given throughout the course to the application of particular normative theories to personal decision-making and to contemporary social and political questions.

HSA Writing Intensive: No|#|PHIL121  SC|^|How Can You Believe That?|^|SPHI|^||^|SC|^|It's no surprise to learn that human beings believe (or at least claim to believe) remarkable things.  Sometimes  the  content  of  what  is  believed  is  strikingly  strange  (as  in  delusions),  sometimes  it  is the fact  that the evidential background is so hostile to the belief  (as  in  self-deception) that provokes our puzzlment  and  wonder. "How  can  they  believe  that?"  we  often  ask.  During  the  semester,  we  investigate various  forms  of  anomalous  beliefs  (e.g.,self-deceptive  and  delusional).  We  consider  the  many  ways  in which  such  beliefs  may  undermine  some  time-honored  views  of  the nature  of  belief.  We  take  up  and evaluate  the  success  of  competing  explanations  of  such  anomalous  beliefs.  We  spend  some  time  with accounts that hold that such apparent beliefs are, in fact, not beliefs at all but other sorts of psychological states. While we do consider some notable historical sources, most of our time is spent with works from the contemporary philosophical and cogitive scientific literatures.|#|PHIL125  SC|^|Classical Chinese Philosophy|^|SPHI|^|38.0101|^|SC|^|This course examines representative schools of Chinese philosophical thought from the classical period: Confucianism, proto-Daoism, and their critics.

|#|PHIL138  CM|^|Epistemology|^|MPHI|^|38.0101|^|CM|^|Every day, we casually sort our judgments into categories. If a belief isn't well-supported, we might say that it is just a guess. If a belief is well-supported, we might say that it is knowledge. In between, we distinguish things like hunches, educated guesses, and reasonable beliefs. These and related distinctions play a fundamental role in our personal and legal relationships. But how, exactly, should we draw these distinctions? What, for example, makes a belief reasonable as opposed to unreasonable? This course introduces students to the basics of epistemology, which seeks to refine and answer these questions. Prerequisite: one prior course in Philosophy.|#|PHIL138  SC|^|Intro Phil of Language & Mind|^|SPHI|^||^|SC|^|A philosophical investigation into thought and reference and the relations between language and mind.

Yet acting against our better judgment, and "giving in to temptation," would appear to be facts it makes little sense to dispute. In this course, we aim to investigate such patterns of self-defeating behavior-addictions, "bad habits," etc., with an eye towards a consideration of such questions as: What is self-control? What makes a "will" strong or weak? Is the self unified? Readings will be drawn from historical and contemporary philosophical sources as well as from the contemporary behavioral sciences.|#|PHIL149  JT|^|Phil Topics: Agency & Action|^|CJT|^|38.0101|^|SC|^|The distinction we draw between what we do and what we undergo - between the active and the passive in our lives - is fundamental to our self-understanding. In this course we investigate the nature of and the puzzles and problems associated with agency and action. Topics to be considered will be drawn from: the casual theory of action, reasons explanation and the role of the normative in the understanding of action, the will and weakness of will, the relation between intention and action, mental action and mental agency, and the relevance of work in the cognitive and the neurosciences to an understanding of agency. This course should be of interest to students of the social, cognitive, and behavioral sciences as well as to students of philosophy. Prerequisite: one course in philosophy.|#|PHIL150  SC|^|Philosophy of Feminism|^|SPHI|^||^|SC|^|Examines several different theories of feminism, their relation to traditional political theories, and their analyses of the causes and solutions to women's oppression.

Readings will include libertarian, liberal, communitarian, Marxist, and feminist political theory.|#|PHIL164  CM|^|Political Phil: Current Debates|^|MPHI|^|38.0101|^|CM|^|The government taxes you and regulates your everyday behavior in countless ways.  It claims the right to draft you into the military and may fine or jail you if you commit a crime.  What, if anything, gives it the right to do these things?  What are the limits on state power?  What obligations does a state have to its citizens, and what obligations do citizens have to the state?  In this course, we'll look at recent work in political philosophy addressing the appropriate relationship between a state and its citizens.  Readings from Rawls, Nozick, Hayek, Cohen, Sandel, and others.  Prerequisite: one previous course in philosophy or permission of the instructor.
|#|PHIL164  SC|^|Seminar: The Moral Deal|^|SPHI|^|38.0101|^|SC|^|If we were to construct a society, what rules might we agree to follow?

The topic for spring 2023 is War and Peace

The topics in Global Ethics vary from term to term, and this semester, the class concentrates on the ethics of war and peace. Are there times when itâs ethical for a country to go to war?  If so, when?  And once a country goes to war, how can it fight ethically, and what would a just resolution to a war look like?  In addition to studying philosophical theories, we will apply those theories to real and hypothetical examples of international conflicts.

But as the frontiers of what is known about natural universe expand further from everyday experience and technologies demand ever more attention and care, how does one make sense of the world? In this discussion-based tour of physical principles, practices and theories, students will ask questions, do Physics, question answers and question the practice of Physics itself. Intended for students without previous scientific background. Letter grade only.|#|PHYS016  PO|^|Art and Science of Optics|^|PPHY|^||^|PO|^|This course will explore historical and current understandings of the science of optics experienced through the prism of the visual arts. Class meetings will include direct study of objects in the collection of the Benton Museum of Art, studio art sessions, and physics labs. Students will explore the work of artists who engaged with principles of geometric optics, such as Johannes Vermeer, Samuel van Hoogstraten, and Rembrandt van Rijn, and they will also recreate and use optical devices, such as the camera obscura and camera lucida. Students will also practice drawing techniques to represent objects in illusionistic perspective as well as perspectival manipulations such as anamorphosis. Course assessment will include written responses to works of art, lab exercises, and final projects incorporating studio art practice.

US Presidency|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|Though the executive branch is relegated to the loosely defined second article of the U.S. Constitution, presidential power has greatly expanded over time and in the process reshaped American politics to revolve around presidential initiative. In the contemporary era, coequal branches of the government defer to the president, while voters look to the president to solve a snowballing set of public problems. However, the rise in executive power has not satisfied expectations, leading to the confounding dual problem of presidents purportedly having too much power in some domains, while still struggling to adequately fix society's most pressing demands.

The language of political liberalism is so ubiquitous that many students will be unaware of how their own moral sensibilities and political intuitions are products of liberal thought.  In contrast, this course investigates Marxist and Post-Marxist political theory to explore radical perspectives on politics, economics, culture, and power. A basic familiarity with liberal political philosophy, while helpful, is not required.

This seminar will introduce students to the field of political science by placing American and international films in conversation with scholarship on power, politics, and storytelling. Each week we will study a film, read related research, and analyze how one informs our understanding of the other. The course will cover ethnic politics, broadly conceived with a particular focus on civil disobedience, protests and political violence. Related topics may include immigration, crime and the state, and urban politics. We will consider a range of questions including, how do stories influence our sense of self, community and nation? How do filmmaking techniques (e.g. cinematography, casting, sound design) influence which people and issues become salient? How do aesthetic and narrative choices affect attitudes about the social order and who is deserving of power? Through close readings of films, social science, and media studies scholarship, this course will enable students to study key political science concepts, the institution of cinema, and how stories make meaning.

Through close readings of both literary and legal texts, the course adopts a humanistic approach to legal scholarship, locating the force of law within its discursive and rhetorical dimensions.  Topics to be discussed include: rights to privacy, sexuality and reproductive freedom; sexual harassment and racist speech; anti-discrimination, integration, and affirmative action.  
|#|POLI145  SC|^|Race, Violence, and the Law|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|This course investigates the relationship between race, violence and law in the American context. Law is often understood to derive its legitimacy from its opposition to violence. And yet, paradoxically, the enforcement of law is inseparably bound to acts of state violence, both threatened and enacted. What role has law played in organized movements to suppress race-based violence? How have appeals to law supplied tools of recourse, resistance, political struggle, and freedom? Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law? Drawing principally from African American political thought, this course considers the relationship between violence and law in three historical contexts: slavery and abolition, segregation and civil rights, and the rise of mass incarceration. |#|POLI145  SC|^|Race, Violence, and the Law|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|This course investigates the relationship between race, violence and law in the American context.

Taking the time to slow down, students are encouraged to linger in the richness and complexity of the text, to find pleasure in thinking more deeply and with care, and to resist feeling pressured always to read instrumentally. Reading slowly reminds us that reading well involves more than efficient processing of information and extraction of key points.

By drawing from readings in cultural studies, Black feminist theory, sociology, philosophy, and decolonial thought, the class explores questions surrounding the archive of transatlantic slavery and its afterlives. A crucial goal of the course is to engage critically the meaning of sexuality, intimacy, reproduction, labor, and domination in slaveholding societies. Throughout the course, students will discuss how the afterlives of slavery inform current ethical debates on issues like: sexual violence, reparations, surveillance, criminalization, incarceration, housing, militarism, imperialism, distribution of wealth, environmental racism, education, mental illness, political participation, and anti-colonial activism. The course is therefore structured less as a historical survey of slavery and more as an investigation as to how slavery is remembered and its rhetorical function when reasoning about today?s moral and political controversies. Special attention is paid to how a study of slavery?s afterlives challenges narratives of U.S. exceptionalism and innocence, as well as stories commonly told about freedom, emancipations, and racial progress. |#|POLI148  PO|^|Comparative Social Policy|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|There is a tendency in some corners of American politics to gaze longingly across the Atlantic and wonder: why don't we have universal health care?  Free college tuition?  State-subsidized child care?  The perception is that Europeans, via robust welfare states, enjoy social benefits that remain out of reach for Americans (or at least those Americans who cannot procure them from the market).  This class takes a comparative approach to social policy in order to better identify why there are differences in approaches to the welfare state, not just between Europe and the US, but within Europe as well.  In addition to exploring key cases and areas of policy coverage, we will also consider how policy feedback loops, neoliberalism, globalization, and demographic change (in particular, aging and immigration) all affect the scope and stability of the welfare state on both sides of the Atlantic.|#|POLI148  SC|^|Study/Struggle: Prison Education|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|Study and Struggle: From Prison Education to Prisoner Solidarity. Study and Struggle is a community engagement course in which ?outside? students collaborate with aligned community partner organizations to facilitate and participate in correspondence-based inside/outside study groups with incarcerated students. While imprisoned people typically lack access to the materials, resources, and programming necessary to support transformative education, Angela Davis reminds us that collective study can ?create lines of communication between prisoners and [outside] students? that are crucial for developing agency and self-determination in a context marked by extreme isolation and oppressive social control. Study and Struggle thus joins in a long tradition of collective study as prisoner solidarity work.|#|POLI150  SC|^|Intro to Public Policy|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|This course addresses the public policy process through policy formulation, implementation, and oversight in the United States.

Since the 1990s, however, more and more of these states have displayed significant weaknesses and fragility.  While they retain formal control over people and territories, many face increased competition from alternative modes of social and political organizations, including "traditional" political systems, non-governmental organizations, religion-based groups, insurgencies and militias, decentralized entities, trafficking networks and internationally-sponsored trusteeship-like arrangements like quasi-permanent UN interventions.  Scholars have tried to capture this increased institutional diversity with notions such as "hybrid effective governance," "heterarchy," "areas of limited statehood," "oligopolies of violence," and the like, calling attention to ongoing processes reminiscent of the birth of the nation state in competition with other forms of organization in late medieval Europe, for example.  Relying on international-relations and comparative-politics literature, this class surveys the rapidly expanding scholarship on the topic, questions the future of the nation-state, and discusses policy implications for the international community. Letter grade only. |#|POLI151  SC|^|Women and Public Policy|^|SPIR|^|45.1001|^|SC|^|This course addresses social dynamics related to femininity and masculinity and the consequent politics and policy choices that evolve from notions of difference between men and women.

And in what ways does past participation in contentious politics affect future political engagement?  This class explores these questions through theoretical readings, case studies from around the world, documentaries, negotiation simulations, and conversations with practitioners.

Black feminism argues that the race/racism, gender identity, and class oppression are inextricably tied together. Womanist theology is a contemporary theological discipline that aims to place African American women at the center of God, The Bible, and life experience. This seminar seeks to place Black feminist thinkers in conversation with womanist theologians. The course aims to interrogate the rise of the first generation of womanist theologians and Black feminist thinkers; examine the coherence of key intellectual ideas; and analyze outstanding social, political, theological issues, and methodological approaches. Readings are exclusively and intentionally from the voices of African American/Black women. |#|POLI158  PO|^|Democratic Decay|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|In 1989, Francis Fukuyama famously declared liberal democracy the 'final form of human government.'

In this course we will read political theorists and actors who take up heated questions concerning the content and reach of public education. The first half of the course engages ideal models of education proposed by liberal, democratic, and radical theorists. The second half of the course looks at how these ideals are taken up by social movement actors in the United States from the era of civil rights and massive resistance to racial integration, through the rise of neoliberal reform and increased school policing, to contemporary curriculum battles and attacks on LGBT youth in schools.|#|POLI189R PO|^|Feminist Political Thought|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|In recent decades right-wing political actors and movements mainstreamed hostility to women and LGBTQ persons and were met by movements for gender and sexual freedom such as #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter. In this course we will read contemporary activists and thinkers, identifying questions for feminist politics, such as: how are our desires, agency, social and political relations shaped by cultural images, messages, and norms; and through what spaces and practices can we heal collectively?

While retaining these core features, modern conservatism has proven highly dynamic in its adaptation to the capitalist market order and mass democracy, giving rise to right-wing populism, authoritarianism, and free-market conservatism. This course will read conservative thinkers alongside historians and social theorists. Themes include racial supremacy, gender hierarchy, nationalism, violence, and the rule of law. The historical focus of the course will be on US conservative movements, from the new right to the alt-right, and the election of Donald Trump.|#|POLI189U PO|^|Public and Private Diplomacy|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|This international relations course explores how nation-states and non-state actors engage in diplomacy using formal private channels (summits, conferences, UN, etc.) and informal mass public platforms - specifically via social media networks.

It is deeply concerned with the rise of China, nuclear proliferation, cybersecurity and the resurgence of global terrorism given the recent U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. At the same time, however, the real costs to America's blood and treasure are driven by a global pandemic and climate change. What's the meaning of "national security", then? What are the U.S. intelligence and national security communities, the "military industrial complex" and how do they relate to civilian policymakers and influence actual policy decisions? Should traditional ways of understanding "national security" and "intelligence" be redefined? If so, how? After successful completion of this course you would not only have addressed these and other related questions in depth but also have a strong sense about how to approach any national security issue from more than one empirically-based angle, as well as a good notion of how to develop your own carefully crafted arguments--i.e. how to think critically--about any national security concern, and beyond.|#|POLI190  SC|^|Senior Seminar|^|SPIR|^||^|SC|^|Students will assess goals for thesis and pursue them via active research and writing, become familiar with conventions of research article writing in political science, learn how to craft an argument situated in an academic literature, and learn how to revise an argument to make it more persuasive.|#|POLI190B PO|^|Sr Sem: Comparativ/Intl Politics|^|PPOL|^||^|PO|^|Explores the question of what can be legally owned, confiscated, or discarded in the 21st century and how this shapes state forms and transnational capitalism.

We begin each historical period with a general background that will allow us to analyze different cultural expressions (literary texts, films, architecture, photography and music)in their original context. The course focuses on several overarching topics, including the creation of the modern Brazilian nation, the cultural encounters between indigenous, Portuguese, and African peoples, and its complex political history. Given that Brazil has such a vast territory, we will also focus on different regions and their contributions to the countrys cultural richness.
|#|PORT001  PZ|^|Introductory Portuguese 1|^|ZMLL|^||^|PZ|^|This first semester of a two-semester introductory course in Brazilian Portuguese leverages the online environment thrust upon us by the pandemic to learn via interactions with a community of grass-roots activists and students fighting for racial justice in Brazil, as well as conversations with Brazilians on topics such as the Brazilian public health system, race, gender and the media, and the current political crisis in Brazil.  Using a communicative approach to language learning with an emphasis on interactive activities and connections to the Brazilian cultural context, students develop conversational skills and knowledge of grammatical structures and vocabulary they can apply to real-world settings.  This course is an ideal choice for students without a background in Spanish (or other Romance languages), students who have never taken a language course before, or those who wish to have more exposure to the language and a solid base in grammar before transitioning into the intermediate level. |#|PORT002  PZ|^|Introductory Portuguese 2|^|ZMLL|^||^|PZ|^|This is the second of a two-semester introductory course in Brazilian Portuguese, using a communicative approach to language learning with an emphasis on interactive activities.

This class explores American democracy and politics through the perspective of politically marginalized groups. This is a radical departure from standard American politics courses that tend to emphasize the role of political elites in drafting the US constitution and shaping the nation's politics. The traditional approach is understandable considering that most minority groups were barred from participating in politics until the passage of the voting rights act of 1965. Democratic institutions, norms and values are broadened when marginalized groups demand and gain inclusion.

The course is divided into three roughly equal-sized sections. The first section offers an introduction to the two philosophical/theoretical traditions in international relations thought: rationalism (and its realist and liberal variants) and social constructivism (and its statist and global variants). The second section covers a series of significant periods in international political history from the emergence of the modern system of states in Europe in the sixteenth century to the end of the Cold War. The third section investigates various issues in contemporary international politics.|#|POST050  PZ|^|Politicl Thought East&West Intro|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|Political Thought East and West: Intro to Political Philosophy

The study of political philosophy focuses on broad assumptions concerning human nature and the character of community organizations that regular activities and seek to promote happiness. These assumptions, structures and goals vary through time and across cultures. This class examines the texts of major theorists representing European, Chinese, Islamic, and Indian political thought and compare their arguments concerning the nature of freedom, justice, equality, authority and responsibility among other fundamental concepts. |#|POST060  PZ|^|Introduction to Public Policy|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|This course provides an overview of the processes

research and secular studies. Students will draw from a wide range of available polling data to 
develop an original paper examining secular beliefs and behaviors among the American public. 
A core issue confronting secular studies within political science and other social sciences 
revolves around conceptualizations and operationalizations of secularism. In other words, what 
do we mean by secularism and how to we measure it? Since students will be undertaking a 
project with original data and analysis, it is imperative that they be precise in their 
conceptualizations and measurements of secularism.  |#|POST070  PZ|^|Research Methods in Polit Stdies|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|This course explores the methods
employed in political studies research. The to primary goals of the course are: 1) to
provide new analytic tools that will help in the critical evaluation of social science
material; and 2) to improve students ability to pose and answer research questions
on their own.|#|POST091  PZ|^|Stats & Data Analysis|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|Statistics and Data Analysis for Politics

This course introduces students to the basic methods of statistics and data analysis in political science research,
with a focus on making causal inferences about how politics works. The same methods also apply to social
science questions of cause-and-effect relationships more generally. This course provides students with extensive
experience in handling data to answer real-world problems. While it has a heavy component of using the
analytical software R, students are not expected to have any prior programming knowledge.|#|POST091P PZ|^|Stats & Data Analysis Practicum|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|Statistics and Data Analysis for Politics Practicum

This practicum is the laboratory companion to POST091, "Statistics and Data Analysis for Politics.â Both must be taken
together to complete the course. In this practicum, students get a chance to practice data analysis hands-on with the
instructor. It focuses on developing coding skills in the software R and implementing specific tasks such as data description
and visualization that enable robust analysis and inference. |#|POST096  PZ|^|Social & Political Justice|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|What is justice? This seemingly simple question has elicited complex responses. Based on their notions of social and political justice, people have developed laws, formed institutions, created political communities, and waged wars. In this seminar, we explore the implications of these debates for contemporary political communities in local and global contexts. Questions include: what makes a political, moral, social or religious order just? Are there certain principles of justice that people across cultural and political boundaries agree upon? How can these debates help us become more informed, engaged, and responsible citizens in our respective communities?|#|POST101  PZ|^|US Campaigns and Elections|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|This course provides an overview of campaigns and elections in the American context.  Topics include political parties, primaries and general elections, voting behavior and turnout, media coverage, campaign finance, election law and prospects for electoral reform, state and local elections, issues and candidate evaluation, and race and gender dimensions of electoral politics.  While considering historical context, we will focus in particular on issues relevant to the elections taking place in 2020. Students will be given the opportunity to participate on a campaign.  |#|POST105  PZ|^|Nat'lism Populism & Social Media|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|Social media plays an important role in comteporary politics. And all around the world, we see the resurgence of populist politicians and political movements. Many of these politicians are master users of the tools of social media, and the movements seem to thrive particularly well in the new media environment. This course explores this interelationship through an exploration of nationalism, an older political ideology that likewise benefited from, and mastered a then-new media enviroment (of newspaper, radio, and television). Is our current digital media-fueled populist moment unique, or are we reproducing an older more durable pattern?|#|POST107  CH|^|Latino Politics|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|The purpose of this course is to explore the contours and evolution of Latino politics. A central element in Latino political history is the role of racial exclusion and multi-racial coalitions in efining Latino political power. Although racial exclusion had been a defining element in Latino history, a critical factor that we will consider as a source of political empowerment is the formation of cross-racial coalitions. This course examines the conditions that make political coalitions between African Americans, Whites, Latinos and other groups possible.
|#|POST114  HM|^|Compar Environmental Politics|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|An examination of the political challenges faced by environmental advocates in diverse countries around the globe. Drawing on the fields of comparative politics and public policy, topics include comparative political institutions, environmental movements, corruption, authoritarian regimes, democratization, lesson-learning across borders, policy reform, gender analysis, decentralization and European unification.

HSA Writing Intensive: No
|#|POST122  PZ|^|Intro to African Politics|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|The course focuses on how the legacies of colonialism continue to affect contemporary African politics. The course chronologically surveys the main issues ranging from pre-colonial political centralization, the slave trade, colonial domination, and rule, and how these structural forces effect 
contemporary political outcomes. The second part of the course focuses on the third wave of democracy bridging historical issues related to colonial and post-colonial autocratic regimes and their implications for Africaâs emerging democracies. The last portion of the class will focus on emerging 
social movements, ethnicity, and the dynamics of contemporary protest movements within burgeoning urban centers across Africa.|#|POST123  PZ|^|Building Political Parties|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|This course carefully explores the theory and practice of building political parties. Questions include: What future exists for political parties? How are they created? What are the possibilities and limitations of party-building as a political strategy? How has party-building changed over time  and how does it differ from place to place? What opportunities exist today for party building today? As a culminating project for the course, students will develop their own plans to build, reform, or recreate a party organization in a particular locality.|#|POST124  PZ|^|Chinese Politics|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|This course provides an overview of China's political system. It begins with a brief historical overview of China's political development since 1949. The remainder of the course examines the institutional features of the current political system and the key challenges facing the CCP leadership focusing on the prospects of political reform. By applying concepts and theories in comparative politics, we will investigate important issues in Chinese politics, including political selection, state-business relations, protests movements, political participation, public opinion, and media and Internet control. Although students are recommended to have taken comparative politics, there are no prerequisites for this course. |#|POST141  PZ|^|International Political Economy|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|Examines the relationship between the
contemporary global economy and the nation-state through Liberal, Marxist and
Realist paradigms. Treats the evolution of the international trading and monetary
systems over the past two centuries, the relations between rich and poor countries,
the roles of global banks and corporations and the transitions to market economies
in Eastern Europe, Russia and China. Background in international politics and/or
international economics is desirable.
|#|POST145  PZ|^|International Human Rights|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|The course offers an introductory level survey of issues pertaining to international human rights. It will examine the historical, legal, and political frameworks related to global human rights. Specific issues of interest will inlcude, among others, the rights of minorities and indigenous peoples, the rights of refugess, cultural rights, human trafficking and slavery, environmental rights, and genocide. Issues will be examined in both global and national contexts. |#|POST153  PZ|^|Why Politics?|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|How and why did Americans become so exhausted with politics?  What might be done about this troubling situation? In what ways is political science implicated in our exhaustion?  This course explores those questions with an emphasis on everyday life. Readings span a range of perspectives, including Arendt, Hegel, the pluralists, American Progressives, liberals, communitarians, contemporary conservatives, chroniclers of political science, and recent work in the environmental humanities.  |#|POST171  PZ|^|The Politcs of Sustainable Water|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|The Politics of Sustainable Water

Water conflict is a political challenge because of normative disagreements among different authorities and end users as to the value of water, its costs, pricing, supply, and uses, and to its inter-connectedness to other critical resources and commodities. To address these issues, policies focusing on sustainability are desperately needed to ensure continued access to clean water. This course is designed to present an interdisciplinary approach to water politics, policy, and resource management by integrating expertise areas to appreciate the inherent complexities and solve critical problems in sustainable water resource policy and management.

Conversely, how is the production of research shaped by policy and politics?  This seminar will feature guest speakers who have practical experience applying research insights in policymaking processes at the local, national, or international level.  Each week our sessions will be divided between these guest lectures and student-led discussions of weekly readings.  The readings will draw on research literatures ranging from political science to policy theory, community mobilization, history, law, Science, Technology, and Society, and many other fields.  Course concepts will be applied to diverse issue areas such as health, social justice, education, and the environment.

This course explores different logics of political authority through an examination of empires, territorial states, tribal and other non-territorial forms of political organization, and tribute systems. Questions include: Whither the state?  How have empires spread historically â and how do they spread today? Have corporations become sovereign? Has the Internet extended imperial authority?  Under what logics of authority are we governed in our everyday lives?|#|POST187  PZ|^|Politicl Econ of Global Football|^|ZPOL|^||^|PZ|^|Spring 2016 - Course will be taught by David Goldblatt.
Football is now the world's most popular and lucrative sport, but how does it actually work?  The course examines the contemporary political economy, business models and governance of football, starting with the English Premier League, before broadening out to  look at a range of global football economies as well as the international politics and economics of sporting mega events.

There are three main components to the course. First a close examination of the political economy and cultural meanings of football in England and begins with the rise of the English Premier league - the richest and most watched football league I the world.  This section of the course will cover the business models of English football, the modelling of its markets, its place within a wider popular culture and its relationship to urban identities; and the complex politics of its governance. Second, the course will be comparative, taking the English model as a starting point and comparing it to the often very different political economy of the major European football nations, Latin America and Africa, and the new and rising powers of world football - East Asia, the Gulf and North America. The course will also compare football to other leading global sports in terms of both economics and governance. Third, the course will examine the global governance of football and the peculiar cultural significance and political economy of global sporting mega events.

The modern Olympic games have been the center-piece of the global sporting calendar for more than a century, the IOC the dominant international sporting organization; in this course we trace the historical processes that created the games, critically examine the moral and political claims that surround them, and examine their cultural impact--from Black Power salutes, to anti-Olympic riots, from sportswomen as national heroes to dictators as Olympic showmen. This course starts with sport but takes you to architecture, art, politics and identity, commerce and capitalism.

How is that psychology created and maintained? In this course we will work with texts by Indigenous scholars-practitioners such as Coulthard, Tuck and TallBear and Black scholars-practitioners such as Fanon to examine these questions. A primary goal of the class is to recognize and understand "settler moves to innocence" (Tuck and Yang, 2012) that hope to both secure settler futures and dissolve current settler guilt and complicity. We will end the semester by looking to aforementioned Black and Indigenous radicals for ways to disrupt and abolish settler-colonialism.|#|PSYC179T HM|^|Human Nature and Genocide|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|Imagine participating in an experiment in which you are asked to shock a "student" who answers questions incorrectly. You are to shock the "student" at increasing rates for every answer they get wrong. Eventually, you are required to shock them at a level capable of killing them. How far would you go? What factors are important in understanding how far you would go? Can evidence from such an experiment provide enough insight into why you may, or may not, be capable of committing acts of genocide? The course goal is to critically analyze experimental social psychology by applying it to the study of human nature and genocide. We will do this by studying classical social psychology paradigms and experiments. We will also engage with theories such as evolutionary psychology, cultural anthropology, Marxist psychology, and critical theoryallowing us to compare and contrast various ways of studying human behavior. In order to aid us in this journey, we will ask questions such as: What role does human nature play in genocide? Can human nature be discovered by the scientific method? Is human nature today the same as it was 15,000 years ago? Or, could genocide have happened 15,000 years ago?

Autonomy, Self-Determination, and Conscience are central concepts in the Cognitive Science of the self and decision-making. Deciding who is autonomous, self-determined, and who does and does not possess a conscience has practical implications for whom clinicians, lawyers, and judges consider mentally competent and responsible for their own actions. The course will address major themes illustrating how interdisciplinary psychological science looks at and specifies what makes agents (human persons and putative AI agents) autonomous, whether this requires people to be fully free of any physical causes of their own brains, how drug use affects conceptions of autonomy in Cognitive Science, how clinical psychiatric and psychological conditions affect conceptions of autonomy in Cognitive Science, and how these conceptions make their way into policy and law. We will also examine what it means to be a self that is self-determining regarding one?s choices, identities, and affiliations, and how conscience emerges from heteronomy to autonomy, and whether there are scientifically defensible constructions of ?trusted autonomy? and moral responsibility in artificial intelligence.|#|PSYC186  PZ|^|Internships in Psychology|^|ZPSY|^||^|PZ|^|This course involves supervised experience

|#|RLST081  SC|^|Precol Afri Chrstian Spiritualit|^|SREL|^||^|SC|^|Precolonial African Christian Spiritualities. There is a widespread and unfortunate perception that African Christianity is a relatively modern phenomenon, that African literature began largely in the twentieth century and only as a response to European colonization, and that African cultures of the last two millenia have had little appreciable impact on the flow of human history. This course will upset these perceptions by drawing on an immense corpus of African Christian writings penned between the second and seventeenth centuries on spirituality, the body, and ritual traditions that were written as much in native African languages (e.g., Coptic, Ge'ez, Old Nubian, Amharic)as they were in foreign lanugages (e.g., Greek and Latin), and that transformed the contours of Christianity in ways still evident today. This course is designed to be appropriate for first-year students and will offer a basic introduction to critical methods in religious studies, including post-/decolonial studies, queer theory, and discourse analysis. |#|RLST084  CM|^|Relig, Race, Civil Rights Mvmt|^|MRLS|^|38.0201|^|CM|^|The course examines the influence of religion on white supremacy and the civil rights movement in the United States from the 1950s through the 1970s. In particular, it explores how religious ideologies, symbols, texts, and narratives were incorporated and employed as strategies and mechanisms for social change in the African American, Mexican American/Chicano, and American Indian civil rights struggles. It will focus on how key leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X, Cesar Chavez, Ralph Abernathy, Reies Lopez Tijerina, Dolores Huerta, Dennis Banks, and others drew on their religious ideologies, symbols, texts, and counter-narratives in their struggles against white supremacy, segregation, political disenfranchisement, and for civil rights and social justice.

The course engages Christian identity formation when articulated from political, ethno-racial, religious, or ideological vulnerability and raises the recurrent question: is Christianity in power authentic Christianity? Suitable for first-years.|#|RLST086  SC|^|Christianity,Capital & Communism|^|SREL|^|38.0201|^|SC|^|This course explores the ethical, political, and historical relationships between wealth, income inequality, and social organization from the earliest Christians to 20th-century communist revolutions in historically Christian countries (e.g., Russia, Ethiopia, Cuba) and beyond. We ask key questions, e.g.: Were early Christians communists? Are Christianity, ethics, & capitalism compatible? How do economics, sex normativity, & Christianity intersect? Are US Christianities imperial religions?|#|RLST087  CM|^|Israel-Zionism & Jewish State|^|MRLS|^|38.0201|^|CM|^|The course surveys the history of the state of Israel, from its ideological beginnings in Jewish tradition and the modern Zionist movement to contemporary religious, political, and social issues. Two areas receive focused attention. The first examines the contrasting and sometimes conflicting Zionist ideologies and the legacy of these ideas as they express themselves in Israel from 1948 to the present. The second focus comes in understanding the ways in which Israel has defined itself as a Jewish state, the role of religion in Israeli politics, law, and society, and the challenges to this identity, including the multiple forms of Jewish identity represented in Israel (e.g., secular, Haredi, Mizrahi), and the presence of large numbers of non-Jewish, Arab/Palestinian, citizens.
|#|RLST090  SC|^|Early Christian Bodies|^|SREL|^|38.0201|^|SC|^|In this course we will explore physical religious behavior, understandings of the human body, and interpretations of bodily experience among early Christian men and women.

This course explores feminist studies of early Christianity (ca. 100-700) as one historical arena that continues to be transformed by new theoretical modes: from recovery/"Herstory" to queer theory, feminist histories illuminate our ancient pasts and our modern desires. |#|RLST095  SC|^|Jesus,Paul,Early Chrstn Sexualty|^|SREL|^||^|SC|^|Jesus, Paul, and Early Christian Sexualities. This course investigates a constellation of early Christian sexualities and their relation to Jesus and Paul, arguably the most influential figures in the trajectory of the religion. We will examine a range of texts, beginning with early Christian writings about Jesus and Paul's own writings, up to the tenth century and written in an impressive array of languages (available in English translation), including Greek, Latin, Coptic, Arabic, and Syriac. Our outlook will be primarily driven by critical-theoretical methods for the study of religion, including feminism, queer theory, post-/decolonial critique, disability studies, and discourse analysis and will have one eye firmly fixed on how Jesus and Paul as figures and/or writers continue to influence society and sexuality today. |#|RLST096  SC|^|Eros & Sex: Antiquity/Byzantium|^|SREL|^|38.0201|^|SC|^|This course traces the relationship between eros and human sexuality from Greek antiquity (ca.600 BCE) through the middle Byzantine era (ca.

The emphasis of this class explores how racial, gendered, and economic inequities construct narratives of deviance that create unique burdens for Black women who are punished for transgressing dominant norms of white middle-class society. Students will examine teachings of sin, sacrifice, and surrogacy and analyze how these church theologies may (or may not) reproduce carceral logic. Students will also interrogate ethical practices, such as politics of respectability, that are harmful and condemn Black mothers' moral agency. Specifically, participants will explore real-life issues, such as the criminalization of poverty and welfare reform, and consider how social and ecclesial appraisals construct poor Black women as unworthy of moral concern. Based on this critical study of adverse church teachings and practices, students will construct helpful ways to apply liberatory womanist religious values with abolitionist principles to shift narratives of deviance and create moral re-appraisals that advocate for the flourishing of Black women beyond punishment and prisons.|#|RLST101B CM|^|Ramayana: Lit/Politics/Culture|^|MRLS|^|38.0201|^|CM|^|This course explores the classical epic Ramayana in a few of the literary, political and cultural contexts in which it has flourished for the past two millennia in South Asia and beyond. We will consider Ramayana as an epic religious narrative that takes many literary forms; as a cultural touchstone whose symbolism has been deployed in political arenas; and as a discourse that has been used to present and contest ideals--a way of talking about everything from gender and social hierarchies to ethical and spiritual dilemmas to love and family.

To meet intellectual, social and political challenges that included state persecution. Buddhist leaders poured their efforts into rearticulating Buddhism under a spectrum of approaches defined by two polarities: (1) conservatives who emphasized restoring Tradition and (2) progressives who favored modernization. We will look at the Buddhist adaptations to modernity, particularly the modern state, from the perspective of religious history, exploring how metaphors of "Tradition" versus "Innovation" can be used toward the preservation and revitalization of religion.

We will examine how the Daoist, Buddhist, and folk traditions of East Asia historically and currently address the question of "What happens when we die?" We will look at different ritual practices surrounding death, dying and the dead in their ongoing relationships with the living. We will also explore various descriptions of the terrain of the afterlife or postmortem world by critically engaging a variety of textual and visual records of China, Korea and Japan. Some of the topics that will be discussed in the course include the nature of the self, the function of funerary rites, the geography of the afterlife, communication with the dead and religious notions of salvation/liberation. By exploring a variety of narratives and practices regarding death and the afterlife, students will develop a rich and detailed picture of the relationship between the living and the dead in the East Asian religious landscape.|#|RLST111  PO|^|Theology, Morality and Policy|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|This course will examine tensions between law and morality within the context of survival and the criminalization of impoverished Black motherhood in the U.S. carceral state. We will explore the ways in which these social dilemmas correspond to public policy paradoxes that assign punitive consequences to target populations considered unworthy of moral concern. Students will also consider the ways in which Christian teachings and practices work together with societal perceptions and policies to reproduce punitive harms that cause individual blame rather than systemic accountability. Finally, students are encouraged to reimagine these retributive teachings and practices within Church and society to realize emancipatory visions for abolition and human flourishing, particularly for poor Black mothers.|#|RLST111  PO|^|Theology, Morality and Policy|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|This course will examine tensions between law and morality within the context of survival and the criminalization of impoverished Black motherhood in the U.S. carceral state.

We start by exploring screenwriting and critical theories about film, race, religion, gender, and social change and then how Hollywood has served as a vehicle for both affirming racial-ethnic stereotypes and/or challenging and resisting them in their desire to rewrite the visual narrative of American history. We analyze and interpret how film can function as a vehicle for racial, religious, political, gender, and/or social commentary, conscientization, protest, and reconciliation.

It will trace the origins of Christian and anti-Judaism, and explore the ways in which Jews and Christians have thought about the other.  We shall attempt to understand what issues divided the two communities, how theological, social, political, and racial concepts contributed to the development of anti-Semitism, how Jews have understood Christians and responded to Christian religious and social claims about Jews, and what attempts have been made throughout history, but particularly since the Holocaust, to establish more constructive relations.

|#|RLST167  SC|^|Early Christian-Muslim Relations|^|SREL|^||^|SC|^|Early Christian-Muslim Relations: Baghdad to Barcelona
Between the sixth and seventh centuries, approxiamately half of the world's Christian population found itself living under Islamic rulers across an immense, three-continental geographical expanse from China to the Atlantic Ocean. This course will investigate how Christians and Muslims interacted in this new matrix of power. We will pay particular attention to non-military encounters-especially since these were less frequent than many suppose, and as such we will focus primarily on texts and material evidence between the seventh and eleventh century that point beyond the dominant "clash of civilizations" model to a more constructive, collaborative, and mutually-understanding model that is based on groundbreaking work in the field of pre-Crusade Christian-Muslim relations. |#|RLST169  CM|^|Christianity & Politics: E.

Attention will be paid to how religion affects experiences of gender; and how gender affects experiences of religion. More specifically, we will explore the way in which the intersection of gender and religion affects understandings, experiences and negotiations of religious origins, personal identities, religious experiences, agency, body shapes, images and disciplines, sexuality, race relations, cultural appropriations and power structures.

We will be analyzing religious teaching, literature, media, pop culture, policy, political discourse and art. The approach taken will be interdisciplinary with intersectional analysis that includes race, gender, sexuality, ability, class, age, mobility, literacy, education, nationality.

Previously offered as GWS 181  PO.|#|RLST184  PO|^|Queer Theory & the Bible|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|This course will look at how the Bible can be read productively through queer theory. We will examine biblical passages that are central to prohibitions on homosexuality and the larger discourses of heteronormativity (constructed around gender, sexuality, class, state formations, migration, kinship, children, etc.) in which homophobic readings of the Bible emerge. We will also look at the ways in which these discourses and the identities they shore up can be "queered," as well as at biblical texts that can be read as queer friendly. This process of queering will allow and require us to approach the biblical text in new ways.|#|RLST187  PO|^|Queering Religion|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|Religion is often queerer than one might imagine. This course looks at religious practices, texts, and traditions that defy the usual assumption that religions insist on binary gender divisions and heteropatriarchal kinship models.  Along the way we question what we mean by "religion" and what we mean by "queer." We consider how sexualities and genders are shaped in and through religious practices, texts, and traditions. We consider the intersections of religion and sexuality with transnational politics, ethnicities, cultures, and power relations. We consider how religious traditions can push back on received norms and create space for queer gender expression, identity, and sexual practice. The course will pay particular attention to how we research and write about queer religious phenomena. Letter grade only. |#|RLST189A PO|^|Contemporary Christian Theology|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|In this close reading of several Christian Theologians, each offering a different perspective, we will ask: How do they reimagine their faith as they respond to racism, misogyny, ethnic cleansing, and violence of all kinds? What is the role of the narrative and moral imagination in their interpretations of Biblical texts and traditional beliefs? Can we, whether Christian or not, find in their theologies strategies for developing our personal worldviews and our responses to the challenges we face in today's worlds?|#|RLST189D PO|^|Religion and Politics|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|Separating religion and politics is a hallmark of modernity. Yet what counts as "religion" or "politics" continues to be a point of conflict. Does politics imitate or even rival divine sovereignty? Is politics possible precisely because it is distinct from divine sovereignty? Does (and should) separation protect religion from politics or politics from religion? What do terms like "faith-based," "free exercise," "establishment," or "toleration" mean? Do religious discourses like prophesy or love of neighbor function as socio-political critiques or do they, instead, depoliticize injustice? We examine how these questions show up in Western thought, through theological works, political theory, court cases, current events, and debates on secularism. While focusing on Christianity and its legacy, we also examine the effects ofthese issues on Judaism and Islam in their confrontations with Christianity, on the one hand, and the rise of the "secular" nation-state, on the other.|#|RLST189D PO|^|Religion and Politics|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|Separating religion and politics is a hallmark of modernity.

The course will consider feminist critiques of religious doctrine and practice, feminist biblical interpretation, and feminist theological approaches to racism, capitalism, homophobia, embodiment and vulnerability, and ecological disaster.  Some time will also be devoted to the interface of feminist theologies with queer and trans theorizing and theologizing.  Readings may include texts by Mary Daly, Judith Plaskow, Delores Williams, Sharon Welch, and Marcella Althaus-Reid.|#|RLST189J PO|^|Prison Religion|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|This course examines the role religion has played in both creating and opposing the carceral state. We will look at how different religious texts imagine crime, punishment, justice, and reform. We will think about the connections and differences between religious practice of human sacrifice and secular practice of capital punishment. We will look at ethnographic and autobiographical writings about prison ministry and religious conversion as well as religious activism around prison abolition. We will also explore the legal, ethical, and political problems that arise when 'faith-based' social service organizations working in the prison system combine social programs with evangelizing.|#|RLST189K PO|^|Muslim (Auto)Biographies|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|First and secondhand accounts of the lives of Muslims, from the famous to the unfamiliar, will provide a glimpse into what it means to be Muslim. The accounts take the form of poetry, personal essays, hagiographies, biographies, autobiographies, films, documentaries. These various expressive mediums will function as a way of exploring how Muslims shape what Islam looks like as a lived religion. These texts will also be read for how local, global, cultural, and other contexts impact the ways Islam and Muslim identity transform and are perceived. In addition to weekly class discussions, students will offer short reflective writings on the readings and produce a final biographical work on a Muslim figure of their choosing.   Students will gain an understanding of Islam as a social phenomenon that is shaped by its practitioners within diverse social, political, and historical contexts.|#|RLST189L PO|^|Encountering the Qur'an|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|This course explores the significance of the Qur'an as both a scriptural text and a source of cultural and religious expression.

In this course we will discuss: the failure of the revolutionary movement (Karl Marx, Rosa Luxemburg) and the rise of totalitarianism that provide the historical context for Critical Theory's search for new possibilities of emancipation; Ernst Bloch's study of utopian aspirations in art and religion; the major philosophical and literary critical works of figures associated with the Frankfurt School (Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin); the plays of Bertolt Brecht; the exiled Frankfurt School's influence in the United States (Herbert Marcuse, Angela Davis, Cornell West, Susan Buck-Morss), with emphasis on its critique of the culture industry, i.e., Hollywood, and the role of media in mass society; and recent developments in postmodern and postsecular critical social theory (Jurgen Habermas, Gillian Rose, Slavoj Zizek, Byung-Chul Han).|#|RLST189Q PO|^|QeerTheory & The Jewish Question|^|PRST|^||^|PO|^|This course investigates the historical and political resonances between Jewishness and queerness; and antisemitism and homophobia. It explores what queer theory has to offer to the study of Judaism and Jewishness and how the analysis of Jewish sacred texts and practices might complicate queer theorizing. We will ask what norms around sex, sexuality, gender, bodily practice, and desire come into view from analyzing Jewish religious thought and practice.

This course explores the shifting representation of women in films across the twentieth century. The Russian Revolution of 1917 promised a radical restructuring of society that would ensure gender equality. How was this new woman represented on the silver screen? What roles were imagined for women in this new society that was often portrayed as highly 'masculine?' How did the changing political situation influence depictions of women in these films? We will explore representations of women as revolutionaries, mothers, war heroes, workers, and muses. In addition to attending to the representation of women on screen, we will also examine the role of women behind the scenes in the Soviet film industry as editors and filmmakers. To explore how this 'new woman' was theorized, constructed, and represented through the new medium of film, we will read a range of texts, including: primary sources that shaped the discourse around gender, sexuality, and feminism in the Soviet Union; film theory; as well as film criticism.|#|RUST114  PO|^|Prison Lit. in Russia & America|^|PGRU|^||^|PO|^|This course explores cultural representations of policing, surveillance, and imprisonment in (pre-revolutionary and Soviet) Russia and America. These two countries have distinct and yet profoundly interlinked histories, and both have been marked by mass forced-labor projects and extensive prison systems.

We will explore topics such as the ethics and aesthetics of writing about prison, the relationship between captivity and creativity, the uses of documentary and fictional forms, the sociology of prison subcultures, and practices of resistance. We will examine how the experience of imprisonment is shaped by categories like race, nationality, gender, and class.

from the social margins toward the mainstream of popular cultures. In particular, we will highlight 1) 
subcultural evolution from an initial congealing to either commodification or evaporation, 2) the distinct 
social hierarchies of subcultures, e.g., policing authenticity and labeling âtrue believersâ and âposers,â 
3) the influence of subcultural participants and motifs on mainstream culture, including cases of 
appropriation, and 4) what subcultures can teach us about the characteristics and pathologies of 
human identity. In examples drawn from Southern California, we will also consider how these 
subcultures are affected by urban geography (vast sprawl in an arid basin, car culture, a range of 
landscapes from beach to mountain), climate (abundant sunshine year-round and Pacific proximity), 
and history (pioneer lineages and manifest destiny).
|#|SOC 060  PZ|^|Religion in the U.S.|^|ZSOC|^||^|PZ|^|Religion in the U.S. : Power and Politics 

In the United States, religion continues to be a powerful social force shaping social inequalities, patterns of inclusion and exclusion of historically marginalized minorities, policy, advocacy, and political dynamics. In the current climate of rising political polarization, religion plays a critical role in shaping and reinforcing social and political cleavages on a variety of issues. Recent controversies surrounding abortion, gun control, LGBTQ+ rights, and COVID health protocols spurred vitriolic debates in U.S. civic spaces. Sociologists have pointed to the often-neglected role of religion in shaping public opinion, political decision-making, and forms of civic participation related to these issues. As a result, the âwall of separationâ between religion and state appears to be not as insurmountable as the founding founders might have imagined it to be. Importantly, the focus of sociologists interested in the relationship between religion, politics, and power continues to be on Christian traditions. The recent growing attention to white Christian nationalism is an example of this trend. This course offers a different perspective by engaging students in an analysis of how both Christian and non-Christian traditions, particularly Islam and Muslim civic practices, influence (or are influenced by) the relationship between religion, power, and politics in the contemporary U.S. context. |#|SOC 075  PO|^|Social and Political Movements|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|Can activism from below change society and political institutions?

How do dynamics between individuals and groups shape and reflect formal political power? Are power inequalities in daily life âpoliticalâ? What is the relationship between economic power, social power, and political power? How do gender, racial, class, and other inequalities inform political activity such as obeying laws and voting? Does the state respond to citizens, serve capitalists, or is it used by bureaucrats? Where and how do citizens engage in politics together and try to create change?  
Political sociology addresses these and other questions. Central to political sociology is the question of how power in society is constructed, legitimated, sustained, and challenged. With a primary focus on the United States, the first half of the fall 2021 version of the course will analyze group power and daily life (including #MeToo and white fragility), white nationalism and the Republican party, fascist politics, and the Democratic partyâs changing relationship to working class concerns. The middle part of the class steps back to examine the notion of democracy and the global eliteâs ability to coopt resistance through neoliberal ideology. Finally, in the last section of the course students will examine social movements generating radical challenges to current forms of inequality and political power, including Black Lives Matter, the #NoDAPL campaign at Standing Rock, Latinx political power, and the fight for a liveable climate future, specifically examining efforts to promote a Green New Deal.

Wokeness is a term created by African Americans and often used as a hashtag in piecemeal ways by
mainstream society. In this course, we will challenge the idea of what wokeness means, its early derivatives, and its true definition by examining mostly early 20th century to more contemporary African American contributors to sociology such as St. Clair Drake,
Dorothy Roberts, bell hooks, Tressie McMillan-Cottom, and Whitney Laster-Pirtle. Much of
African-American social thought represents different attempts to grapple with American institutionalized racism and its changing face, and the diversity of viewpoints and perspectives we will encounter here will reflect the diverse manifestations of this racism and why being "woke" requires more than simply using the term to signify understanding. |#|SOC 110  PZ|^|Classical Sociological Theory|^|ZSOC|^||^|PZ|^|This course examines some of the most important and influential thinkers who helped create and shape the discipline of sociology: Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Du Bois, Gilman, etc. Strongly recommended for students considering graduate school.|#|SOC 114  CH|^|LA Communities:Trans/Ineq/Actvsm|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|Los Angeles Communities: Use of case study approach to explore the interplay between economic and demographic transformations and community dynamics.

and atheist views have always coexisted with Black faith.
Historically, Black humanists have grounded their beliefs in an anti-racist social justice critique that was distinct
from that of European American secular humanists. For generations, African American secular humanist
inquiry has provided Black thinkers, activists, and educators with a platform to explore questions of race, ethics,
democracy, gender, sexuality, white supremacy, and capitalism; as well as global citizenship, American national
identity, utopia and dystopia. This course will focus on how these traditions shaped Black liberation, resistance,
intellectualism, and creativity. It will explore nineteenth century slavery-era critiques of organized religion from
thinkers like Frederick Douglass and Fanny Barrier Williams; discuss literary portrayals of skepticism by
twentieth century writers and artists such as Zora Neale Hurston, Lorraine Hansberry, Richard Wright, James
Baldwin, Nella Larsen, Alice Walker, and Octavia Butler; and examine contemporary twenty first century
secular humanist, freethought and atheist activism, scholarship, art and social media among educators, writers,
bloggers, and organizations who are challenging the dominance of religious faith in communities of color.

Engaging in the healthcare sector (or other arenas which have a health-oriented focus) not only provides a lens as to the relationships between health consumers and health providers, but also provides students with experiential knowledge of various arenas within the U.S. healthcare systems. Over the semester, students work at least 4 hours a week in an internship of their interest but will not necessarily be providing actual treatment of patients. In addition, our class meets once a week in which we will discuss poignant readings related to the healthcare system that not only focus on the lives of health consumers/patients but also more critically examines the social relationships. |#|SOC 189A PO|^|Media and Society|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|This course applies the insights of sociology to the study of media and culture.

Students will accomplish this by analyzing a wide array of literary works, emphasizing those from historically marginalized groups (women, people of color, members of the LGBTI community, migrants and their descendants, low-income groups, and others), from a sociological perspective. The course is based on two key ideas: (1) that human imagination and creativity are key elements for any form of social change, and (2) that a dialogue between sociology and literature is an engaging and multidisciplinary pedagogy that will help students realize the crucial importance of listening to all voices; especially those of the groups that have been historically devalued or ignored.

In our sociological study of the environment, we will learn how questions like these and global problems we might be familiar with are connected to issues of race, class, gender, power, and capitalism. Through exploring topics as diverse as pollution, indigenous approaches to resource management, climate justice, and vulnerability to pandemics, we will look beyond technical and scientific aspects of contemporary environmental issues to their social roots and implications. |#|SOC 189K PO|^|Globalizing Participation|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|In this class, students will learn about the institutional innovations public officials and historically marginalized groups (women, people of color, members of the LGBTI community, migrants and their descendants, low-income groups, and others) have come up with in order to make public policies more inclusive around the world. A particular emphasis will be given to countries from the Global South, where most of these innovations are being created. Although Participatory Budgeting (PB) is the most famous of these innovations, the class will critically examine PB and many others as well as the multiple ways in which they have become globalized as different actors share them and/or transform them into international best practices. Letter grade only.|#|SOC 189M PO|^|The Medicalization of Social|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|This course will explore the phenomenon of medicalization, or the process by which more and more of social life and human behavior have come to be understood and governed through medical categories.

Students will be encouraged to use course material to think reflexively about their own positions within consumer society. Letter grade only.|#|SOC 189T PO|^|Sociology of Waste|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|What is waste? How do conceptions and concerns about waste shape and get shaped by society? Drawing on sociology and related disciplines, we will examine how inequalities related to waste management are structured by gender, race, class, ethnicity, sexuality, disability, etc. under capitalism. We will also analyze case studies of global waste regimes, including Western clothing waste and secondhand clothing markets in Latin America and Africa; nuclear waste and Europe; food waste and topsoil loss; toxic waste and BIPOC communities; household waste and waste-collectors in the Middle East; plastic waste and Pacific Island states; and recycling in China and India.  |#|SOC 190  PO|^|Senior Seminar|^|PSOC|^||^|PO|^|An advanced seminar on a selected topic in sociology.

As such, this class not only provides a reflective lens but also provides students with the opportunity to engage challenging and diverse readings as well as participate in active, stimulating and fun class discussions. Over the semester, students will have the opportunity to reflect on what you have learned in your sociology courses in three distinct ways: a) becoming an expert in discussing a particular social institution - either one you engaged or didn't engage at Pitzer; b) create and submit blog posts using media and quotes to our class Tumblr page (site under construction) - these posts will serve as a way of showing that you can teach sociology to the general masses and c) applying your sociological expertise to a real-world situation and make policy recommendations. In addition, our class meets once a week in which we will discuss poignant readings related to the study of social structure that not only focus on the lives of individuals within social groups but also more critically examines the social relationships that foster social inequity and/or foster social change. |#|SOC 199B PZ|^|Senior Thesis|^|ZSOC|^||^|PZ|^|Advanced Independent Research Project/Thesis: All sociology majors planning to write a senior thesis/research project must enroll in this class, which will serve as an anchor for your work-- helping you write your thesis/research project & guiding you through all the steps along the way.|#|SOSC150  HM|^|Public Speaking/Sci & Citizenshp|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|This course builds student speaking skills in three areas: communicating advanced topics in science and technology to non-specialists; speaking out on questions of politics and values; and engaging the intersection of the two through presentations on technically intensive social controversies.

Since the continent was colonized, Afro-Latin Americans have been portrayed and have portrayed themselves in literary and musical works, as in visual media. In this course, we will examine written and visual texts from the 17th to the 21st century and discuss how stereotypes about Black people were created, spread, and perpetuated by the different media. We will also discuss how Afro-Latin Americans challenged and contested stereotypes in their artistic endeavors. In addition to reading criticism of the works being studied, we will also read theoretical texts on coloniality and representation.  Pre-requisite; Any SPAN100 or above.

cultural practice of Uruguay and Buenos Aires, Argentina from 1880 until today. We will
put special attention to the agents without a voice, in particular people of color and
gender minorities. We will explore the work of musicians, poets, singers and dancers
who played a crucial role and were consistently erased in the history of tango (for
instance Rosendo Mendizabal, Paquita Bernard, and members of the Tango Queer
Movement).
The class will include sources drawn from social sciences, journalism, testimony, film and
literature, and will have a Seminar format.|#|SPAN133  SC|^|Translation & Right to Language|^|SHSP|^|16.0908|^|SC|^|133. Translations of Latin America and the "Right to Language."
Is translation an impossible task? This course will first examine key theories of translation (Schopenhauer, Von Humboldt, Nietzche, Benjamin, Pax, Ortega y Gasset, Borges, Derrida) to help us think about the issues that surround the practice of translation. The second phase of the course will allow us to translate from Spanish into English parts of key literary texts by Asturias, Cabrera Infante, Valenzuela at the same time we compare our work to that of their "official" translations by translators such as Rabassa and Levine. Finally, we shall explore translation as a practice that often contributes to a history of inequality among languages and people from different ethnic backgrounds. Prerequisite: Spanish 101. M. Perez de Mendiola.
|#|SPAN134  SC|^|Indig Women, Represent, & Strug|^|SHSP|^||^|SC|^|Throughout this current post-colonial era, we have witnessed emergent indigenous initiatives that have sought to challengedominant social, economic and gender structures in Latin America. Among the rangeof approaches that study these initiatives, the field ofâindigenous feminismâhas remained an era of contention among indigenous and non-indigenous scholars as well as activists. The course will focus on how current emancipatory thought and practice led by indigenous women has challenged that the ethnocentric andhomogenizing assumptions embedded in certain critical perspectives and feminist traditions. This course will explore a broad range of interdisciplinary theories and studies (across the social sciences and humanities)as well as literary and cinematic representations that have shaped leadership and cultural analysis for indigenous women in Latin America, specifically Peru, Bolivia, Mexico and Guatemala. Along with representation of indigenous peoples by non-indigenous critics or authors, we will also study initiatives of self-representations in testimonio and films in order to analyze how the use of different media hasbecome a key factor for conveying memories of struggle and for the ongoing reformulation of past legacies in the context of the neoliberal era. |#|SPAN134  SC|^|Indig Women, Represent, & Strug|^|SHSP|^||^|SC|^|Throughout this current post-colonial era, we have witnessed emergent indigenous initiatives that have sought to challengedominant social, economic and gender structures in Latin America.

This course is an exploration of Los Angeles, the history and stories of the main groups that inhabit it, and some of its current complexities. It explores the lives of Angelinos and the urban spaces they inhabit; their everyday cultural practices, music, and art; and the cultural geography and environmental quality of the city. Some emphasis is on the Latino community living in LA, in the context of other ethnicities, social inequalities, frictions, struggles, and challenges ahead. Students might work on documenting short stories of Angelinos against the backdrop of the citys visual culture. This class is part of the Digital Humanities project at the Claremont Colleges.

Be aware that this class takes place mostly in Los Angeles, and we will travel to different sites of the city every Friday, so you need to be available Fridays from about 8:45 am to 6:30 pm. The schedule posted for the class, 1:15 - 4:15 pm, is only for the four classes that will take place on campus. This is a very intensive class with a demanding schedule, and you will also have to set aside time to read background material and research various topics.

|#|SPAN136  PZ|^|Caribbean Popular Culture|^|ZSPA|^||^|PZ|^|This course will focus on analyzing Caribbean popular culture (mainly from the Spanish-Speaking
Caribbean) from a chronological perspective in order to consider how critical terms that inform the
critical analyses of literary, musical and performance cultures in the Caribbean region are shifting.
We will map these shifts from the working-class musical genres which acquired a national recognition
after been considered for decades as inferior culture. We will consider how the urban setting redefined the new Black subculture of drugs and marginality. The course will link reggaeton/raggadancehall with activism, and generally we will consider the issues of citizenship/ migration, and sexuality. |#|SPAN137  PZ|^|Strategies of Resistance in Lat|^|ZSPA|^||^|PZ|^|This course will examine different recent strategies of political, social, and cultural resistance in Latin American countries, from the cycle of mobilization against neoliberal policies and their effects in the 1990s and 2000s, to the new resistances against ineffectual systems of democratic representation. We will explore cases such as student protests in Chile and Mexico, womens movements in Argentina and Mexico (#NiUnaMenos, #NiUnaMas), as well as some of the contemporary tools of activism and resistance provided by the new global communication networks.
The class will include sources drawn from social sciences, journalism, testimony, film, and literature, and will have a Seminar format.
|#|SPAN137  SC|^|Translating the Aztecs|^|SHIS|^|16.0908|^|SC|^|This course considers the translation of Aztec (Nahua) culture across time and mediums such as pictographic books, alphabetic writing, theatrical performance, and film. The moment of conquest will serve as a pivot as we trace a genealogy of indigenous cultural expression through these varied mediums from pre-Columbian times to the present, paying particular attention to alphabetized Nahuatl as a colonial tool of domination that complicates standard ideas of literacy. Against these ideas, students will explore, through artistic projects, alternatives to logocentric "literature." Coursework includes introductory Nahuatl lessons, paleography using archival documents, and translation workshops. |#|SPAN138  PZ|^|Spanish on the Stage Practicum|^|ZSPA|^||^|PZ|^|Spanish on the Stage: Theater Practicum

The course combines the study of Spanish texts related to drama with the practice of some acting and performing skills. The class explores various theatrical styles, analyzing their development and examining how they relate to Hispanic culture. The students will also put into practice some creative techniques in Spanish. Taking the "performer's place" should provide the students with self-confidence and independence in the use of the language, considering that they have to perform and even improvise theatrical scenes.|#|SPAN139  SC|^|Plants, Land, and Food|^|SHIS|^|16.0908|^|SC|^|Plants, Land, and Food: Community Clinic.
In this community engaged clinic, students will design a human-based project that responds to a need in their/our communities based around agriculture and food cultivation. In the first part of the course, students will identify and research a community organization that serves Spanish-speaking communities. Potential organizations in Claremont/Pomona include Uncommon Good, the Pomona Community Farmer Alliance, and Buena Vista Community Garden. In the second part of the course, students will reach out to their organization of choice and design a project. And in the third part of the course, students will carry out the project and then review and revise it. This process will help students to build humility and empathy as they address a need in their communities. A sustained engagement in an agricultural practice, in turn, will help students develop an appreciation for the land and sustainable land use. Conversations with the professor will be in Spanish and students will write four reflections papers in Spanish that document their efforts and address any challenges or breakthroughs.

We will pay close attention to how conceptualizations of blackness are deployed-simultaneously highlighted and erased-during different iterations of nation-building projects in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico. We will also explore the place of indigenous peoples in Caribbean national imaginaries. Our studies of novels, short stories, political essays, films, and other audiovisual materials will allow us to analyze how the intersections of race, gender, and sexuality are "translated" into Caribbean identity formation both nationally and transnationally.

|#|SPAN159  PO|^|Multilingual Spain|^|PRLL|^||^|PO|^|Language in Spain functions as a source of communal identity and a site of political contestation. Spanish is the official language of the State, and regional languages such as Catalan and Basque are "co-official" in their respective territories. In this course we will investigate the linguistic situation of contemporary Spain, learning a range of concepts from the field of sociolinguistics: language standardization; language maintenance and revitalization; language and identity; language policy and bilingual education; and linguistic discrimination. We will also consider the role that language has played in recent debates about Catalonian independence, the status of immigrants in Spanish society, and the relationships among ethnicity, class, and nationhood. Prerequisites: SPAN101  PO.|#|SPAN163  PZ|^|Afrolatinidades|^|ZSPA|^||^|PZ|^|This course examines the black experience in Latin American history and society from the slavery era to present day. Latin America as a vast geographical space cannot possibly be comprehended in one class; therefore, excerpts from a variety of disciplines will be studied thematically in an effort to encompass a broad, but not diluted, understanding of the issues that have historically faced Afro-descendants in the Latin American continent. It will look specifically at the ways in which Afro-Latino artists have represented blackness and designed their own subjectivities and agencies. |#|SPAN163  SC|^|Pais Vasco or Euskal Herria|^|SHSP|^||^|SC|^|Basque people (euskaldunak) are considered one of the oldest indigenous ethnic groups of Europe; its language is a mystery.

The aim of this course is to introduce students to Basque culture from a historical, linguistic, anthropological, political and artistic perspective. As one of the most unique regions of Spain, it provides a fertile ground to analyze decentralized forms of knowledge. We will tackle issues such a nation/nation state, ethnicity and identity politics; sexualities and gender, tradition and modernity. The course will also examine Basques in the American diaspora.

This course reflects upon the premises and promises of interculturality through an analysis of literature, testimonies and films by mestizo and indigenous authors from the Andean region. We critically engage in discussions around prevalent ideologies of mestizaje and bilingualism, as well as address the politics of relations among cultures historically in dispute. Philosophies of translation will be key for the analysis of how these cultures related and struggle to coexist.|#|SPAN184  SC|^|The Image and the Word|^|SHSP|^||^|SC|^|The relation between writing, painting, photography and cinema might at first be viewed as a simple and familiar combination of visual and verbal art as felicitous interplay based on affinity and compatability.  However, it also generates numerous theoretical speculations with far-reaching implications for the theorization of art and literature.  The potentially frictional relations between the visual image and the written text are especially pertinent for a discussion of the artworks of many Latin American and Spanish artists and writers.  Prerequisite Spanish 44.

We will look at how films and works of fiction from Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Argentina, and other countries represent how people have impacted the ecology around them, and in turn, have been shaped by the physical environment. The works of fiction and films that will be discussed grapple with issues such as water scarcity, air pollution, deforestation, and the rise of consumerism. We will analyze these works through the intersectional lens of gender, ethnicity, class, race, and social justice. Prerequisite: SPAN044|#|SPAN191  PO|^|Senior Thesis|^|PRLL|^||^|PO|^|Senior Thesis.

By tracing stories of crises across genres and disciplinesfrom science fiction to science articleswe will explore how apocalyptic and dystopic modes of thinking shape the ways we imagine our environment and ourselves. As we survey catastrophes from the atomic bomb to climate change, we will ask: What is the relationship between storytelling and science? How can art and literature enable us to imagine more resilient, just futures? In exploring such questions, our class will unearth systems of power embedded within narratives of environmental crises as we tackle questions of intergenerational and environmental justice. |#|STS 179N HM|^|Imagining Env/Climate Justice:CA|^|HHSS|^||^|HM|^|This course will explore the historical and ongoing quest for environmental and climate justice in California. Through the lenses of art and literature, we will investigate how systems of injustice shape the contours of environmental phenomena. As we survey California environmental issues ranging from wildfires to pollution to housing, we will ask: What is the relationship between storytelling and environmental justice? How can art and literature enable us to imagine radical forms of communion and more equitable, resilient futures? By turning a critical, generative lens on our own surroundings, we will embrace placed-based, experiential learning as we take our own local environment as an object of study so that we may both understand and, hopefully, benefit the environment that the Claremont Colleges call home. As such, the class will include field trips, which may include a few Saturday excursions. Course texts will span disciplines, from speculative film and postcolonial literature to environmental investigative journalism and iphone applications.

"Thereâs no such thing as neutral education. Education either functions as an instrument to bring about conformity or freedom.â -- Paulo Freire, Pedagogy of the Oppressed.  So many students (and faculty, and staff) have experienced higher education as a place of conformity, isolation, and oppression. However, another way is possible. Liberatory educators like Paulo Friere, bell hooks, and Sara Ahmed invite us to imagine classrooms and colleges as spaces of freedom, where raucous and rebellious communities co-construct knowledge together and use it to build a more just and equitable world for all. In this course, we will engage with these scholars and ideas, add our own experiences and knowledges to what they share, and begin to construct a vision for liberatory learning at Pitzer and beyond.  |#|WRIT016  PZ|^|The Writing Process|^|ZWRI|^||^|PZ|^|This is an introductory course in composition designed to develop the reading, critical thinking, and writing strategies, including research and documentation skills, necessary for academic success. The class emphasizes using sources to craft well-organized, original scholarly arguments. Students will practice writing in several different expository and argumentative genres, including autobiography, reflection, explanation of concepts, and defending a position on a controversial issue. Before each assignment, we will spend time discussing the writing process, from brainstorming to making final revisions and acknowledging sources. Students will also have the opportunity to learn from peers by critiquing their written work. There will also be a midterm exam. 
A series of shorter analysis papers will culminate in a longer final paper that will require additional reading and research on a specific political or social issue. This paper should be based on a research question that is meaningful to you personally- something that you feel passionately about. You will investigate what respected scholars have had to say regarding this issue. After weighing the evidence presented within these sources, you will formulate your own position and express it in a scholarly way.

This course seeks to analyze how language, culture, class, and identity affect our ways of communicating through speaking and writing, and apply strategies to help us make choices that build on our strengths and enhance our communication skills.|#|WRIT105  SC|^|Writing and the Liberal Arts|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|We'll investigate the rhetoric of arguments regarding current challenges for the liberal-arts curriculum, asking questions such as: What are the traditional liberal arts, and how are they being re-defined today in response to larger shifts in the culture? Why should or shouldn't anyone pursue the liberal arts? Why is it so hard for colleges to decide which subjects are required? What is the value of a liberal-arts education in an increasingly commodified world? What is the definition and value of diversity in the liberal arts? Are new values
threatening to overshadow basic pursuits into knowledge and truth, and is this good or bad? Our examination will translate into working together towards designing, developing, shaping, and polishing clear and detailed compositions. Assignments will likely include debates or mock trials on our main questions, analytical responses to the readings, workshops and reviews of classmates compositions, a mission statement for a liberal-arts college, and a defense or critique of a requirement at the Claremont colleges.|#|WRIT109  SC|^|Writing Studio|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|In this writing workshop, students develop their understanding of the academic writing process, including prompts and disciplinary conventions; invention, brainstorming, and prewriting; drafting, revision, and editing; peer response; critical thinking; research; and oral presentation.

We will focus on how dictionary entries and metaphors, instruments that define words by using other words, construct, and limit our daily perceptions.  We?ll dig into etymologies and trace the histories of contested terms and cultural keywords such as identity, gender, iconic, liberal, celebrity, and so on.  We willstudy how figures of speech evolve from the concrete to the abstract and how they influence the way we think about the world.  Throughout the course, we?ll consider how our commonplace terminology is historically loaded, seemingly determinate, and yet open to change.  To do this, we will read theoretical works by J.L. Austin, Raymond Williams, Marjorie Garber, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, Guy Deutscher, and Elizabeth Knowles, as well as applied pieces by Annette Kämmerer, Jill Lapore, Emily Martin, John McWhorter, Leslie Jamison, and others.

We?ll begin with the economic and cultural  origins  of  writing.  Our  case  study  will  be  the  evolution  of  Chinese  graphs,  the invention  of printing in China, and its spread westward. We?ll then examine studies of the early modern printing press in Europe, the growth of literacy, and its consequences for the period?s colonial  encounters  between literate  and  non-literate  societies. Next, we?ll explore  modern writing  technologies  such  as pencils  and computers.  We?ll conclude  by  reading  contemporary findings  on  the  relation  between  writing  and cognitive development, including education and psychological healing.|#|WRIT120  SC|^|Tech Rhetorics|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|In this course, we examine theoretical and practical approaches to technical and nonprofit writing.

It has also been  viewed as an ethical conundrum, a violation of journalism's most sacred tenets, because it foregrounds the journalist's experience and uses storytelling techniques  associated  with  fiction  writing.  Does  the  "literary"  nature  of  this  genre  of  journalism  destroy "objectivity" and hinder the search for "truth"? or does it allow for a more immersive access into "truth?" We will pursue this question by reading the historical antecedents of literary journalism beginning in the eighteenth century  and  discuss  its  practitioners  through  to  the  present  day,  spending  time  on the genre's social justice tendencies and its gradual entry into mainstream journalism in the early-and mid-twentieth century.  Students  will  practice  various  approaches  to this subgenre  and  work  to  put  together  a  Literary Journalism publication by the end of the semester.

This course is an Inside-Out course. Inside-Out courses are regular college courses that are part of the international Inside-Out Prison Exchange Center model that "bring together campus-based college students with incarcerated students for a semester-long course held in a prison." The Claremont Colleges Inside-Out program takes place at California Rehabilitation Center, a level II men's prison in Norco, CA. These courses are slated as "Permission of Instructor Required" so that the faculty members can fully explain the nature of the course and request students to complete an application or interview prior to enrollment. Students should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing (available through Student Healthcare Services for $10), and the need to submit personal information for background checks.|#|WRIT132  SC|^|Arts + Culture Review|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This course is a writing workshop designed to enhance your skills in the journalistic review.

We will examine the editorial as the most economical and condensed example of argumentative writing that exploits the full range of rhetorical techniques. We will read editorials on a variety of topics (some chosen by the class). For these readings, our main task will be to scrutinize each argument's logic and its author's strategies to gain credibility. Assignments will include exercises on logic and logical flaws, imitations of prose styles, and a portfolio of editorials. |#|WRIT137  SC|^|The Newspaper Op-Ed|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|Intermediate Argument: The Newspaper Editorial

We will read examples of the genre from highly regarded practitioners as well as more theoretical work, and we will talk about the ethics and formal conventions of working in each area. Assignments will include writing in each area of this genre and critical responses to the work of others (both published work and that of peers).|#|WRIT140  SC|^|Creative Nonfiction|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This workshop-based course focuses on creative nonfiction, defined as prose focusing on actual events or circumstances in the authors experience depicted using the techniques of creative genres (fiction, poetry, drama). Subfields of the genre include literary or lyric essays, memoir, and literary journalism. We will read examples of the genre from highly regarded practitioners as well as more theoretical work, and we will talk about the ethics and formal conventions of working in each area. Assignments will include writing in each area of this genre and critical responses to the work of others (both published work and that of peers).|#|WRIT145  SC|^|Women's Memoir/Writing|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This course proposes to examine the revolutionary aspects of the memoir through women's memoirs of varied backgrounds and proposes to engage students in the political and healing journey of writing their own life stories through nonfiction essays and blurred genres. Themes addressed will include: childhood, violence, survival, memory, death, race, spirituality, generational difference, sexuality, class, and migration. Students should expect to take part in weekly discussions on assigned readings as well as to workshop writings generated in and out of class by their peers. Text may include literature by the following: Patti Smith, Sandra Cisneros, Dorothy Allison Eula Biss, and Miriam Toews.  For the Fall 2019 class, Miriam Toews is confirmed to hold a private class session with members of the course during her visit to campus November 12 with Scripps Presents/HBA Lecture funds. |#|WRIT146  SC|^|Academic vs Creative Non/Fiction|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|In this course, students will have the opportunity to investigate the techniques and properties of academic and creative non/fiction writing while also assessing which forms and outlets best suit informed readerships and target audiences. Students will engage independent research on topical issues of personal or political interest, seek out the best outlets for these, then write (and workshop) academic and creative pieces related to their research. The objective of the course is to have students engage in and distinguish between forms of writing, gain confidence in them, and to pliably move between them as they seek to connect their interests with appropriate reading audiences. What distinguishes research from academic as opposed to creative non/fiction pieces? Where can autobiography or personal experience intersect in such writing? What rhetorical strategies work best in sustained academic or creative non/fiction intended for informed audiences and invested publics? |#|WRIT153  SC|^|Introduction to Podcasting|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|In this course, to ground us in the foundations of today?s rapid rise in audiobooks and podcasts, we begin with tradition of oral storytelling in ancient Greece and in African and African?American traditions. We will then examine a range of approaches to podcasting and the ways in which these approaches connect with and disrupt more other forms of argument?driven writing. Students will select a podcast and analyze the way it presents and tells a story about a specific topic, considering both the text and accompanying audio content and sounds. Students will then create and deliver their own podcast episode.|#|WRIT153IOSC|^|Introduction to Podcasting|^||^||^|SC|^|In this course, to ground us in the foundations of today?s rapid rise in audiobooks and podcasts, we begin with tradition of oral storytelling in ancient Greece and in African and African?American traditions.

This course is an Inside-Out course. Inside-Out courses are regular college courses that are part of the international Inside-Out Prison Exchange Center model that "bring together campus-based college students with incarcerated students for a semester-long course held in a prison." The Claremont Colleges Inside-Out program takes place at California Rehabilitation Center, a level II men's prison in Norco, CA. These courses are slated as "Permission of Instructor Required" so that the faculty members can fully explain the nature of the course and request students to complete an application or interview prior to enrollment. Students should also be aware of special course demands, which include up to an additional hour time commitment both before and after class times for transportation to/from the prison and clearance processes at the prison, the need for TB testing (available through Student Healthcare Services for $10), and the need to submit personal information for background checks.
|#|WRIT160  SC|^|Theories & Pedagogies of Writing|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|This course is an advanced introduction to composition studies. Well examine influential essays from our discipline, mostly theory and case studies on teaching writing. In addition, well observe and conduct mock tutorial sessions, practice responses to student writing, and present and discuss examples of particularly good or bad instructional sessions.|#|WRIT165IOSC|^|Prison Writing Center Praxis|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|In this course, inside and outside students discuss the theory and practice of an Inside/Out Writing Center. Students read about and then practice various kinds of writing center pedagogy, prison writing pedagogy, and all aspects of the academic essay writing process. In doing so, they engage in nuanced discussions of the politics of academic writing, the English language, and college pedagogy; they also discuss studies of incarceration and of writing pedagogy in prisons, some of which focuses on the Inside/Out program itself. Assignments include prewriting, reflective writing, and essay-writing and revision; small-group peer workshop; full-class workshop; mock tutorial and debrief; discussion of readings; presentations; sentence-level editing; and oral presentation skill-building.

It also presumes a working relationship with the faculty member whose students are being tutored and allows group tutoring and workshops in the classroom. We will examine the history of this kind of tutoring and the discussions of its theory, scholarly research, and practice in the discipline of Writing Center Studies; we will also develop a working Inside-Out pedagogical praxis for it in the classroom and pilot it in other Inside-Out courses. Students will write responses to the readings, observe and critique tutoring sessions, and work on adding a section on this kind of tutoring to the CRC Writing Center Handbook.

We will examine the history of this kind of tutoring and the discussions of its theory, scholarly research, and practice in the discipline of Writing Studies; we will also develop a working Inside-Out pedagogical praxis for it in the classroom and pilot it in other Inside-Out courses. Students will write responses to the readings, observe and critique tutoring sessions, and work on adding a section on literacies to the CRC Writing Center Handbook.

This course requires at least one hour before and one hour after of travel time to our classroom at CRC prison.

In this course, we will learn to read as writers do, beginning with sentences and ending with the structure of novels. To do this, we will be reading a variety of authors - hundreds in fact! - looking at how they accomplish their storytelling effects and experimenting with those effects in classroom exercises. This will also be a workshop class, in which we comment on student work in the light of what we've discovered. Enrollment limited to detectives, vampires, and geeks. |#|WRIT197H SC|^|Spec Topics: Investigative Fict|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|Courses under this number will vary from year to year, and will focus on a close analysis of a given genre (the essay, the short story, the poem, the newspaper article, the screenplay, the review) by an established practitioner of the form.

SP19: Our focus will be on investigative fiction: a hybrid form of writing that is at once highly personal and deeply researched. This approach transcends genre, and can be exercised in writing that is otherwise described as the non-fiction, or documentary novel, biography, autobiography or autofiction. We will be writing two original texts during the semester, working under the influence of selected texts by writers such as Janet Flanner, George Orwell, Carlos Monsivais, Colette, Frank Sargeson and Chester Himes. |#|WRIT197J SC|^|Topics: Eye-opening Writing|^|SWRI|^||^|SC|^|"Light on the walls of old houses, June.

What magic can be wrought by translating the physical world into words? We'll work rigorously on short pieces of our own prose, and we'll read selected texts by, among others, Agnes Martin, Shirin Neshat, Susan Sontag, Esmé Weijun Wang, and Maria Gainza.
